## PART ONE. THE REDISCOVERY OF TRAUMA. 
## CHAPTER 1 
### LESSONS FROM VIETNAM VETERANS

* In 1978, author's first day as a staff psychiatrist at the Boston VA Clinic
* Encountered a veteran named Tom, suffering from PTSD due to experiences in Vietnam
* Tom experienced nightmares, flashbacks, and intense fear, leading him to isolate himself from family
* **Tom's background**: valedictorian of high school class, enlisted in Marines after graduation, became platoon leader in Vietnam**
* After returning home, attended college on GI Bill, graduated from law school, married, and had two sons
* Felt disconnected from his wife and dead inside, despite a thriving law practice and picture-perfect family
* Tom's story reminded author of her own experiences growing up with parents who had been traumatized during World War II
* Author focused on treating Tom's nightmares with medication but he refused to take it
* **Realized that Tom's loyalty to his fallen comrades was keeping him from living his own life**
* Recognized the complexity of trauma and its impact on veterans' lives
* Struggled to find resources and knowledge to help veterans, leading her to question the lack of research on wartime trauma
* Discovered "**The Traumatic Neuroses of War**" by Abram Kardiner, which described similar symptoms in World War I veterans and coined the term "traumatic neuroses," now known as PTSD.
* *Kardiner* noted that **traumatic neuroses have a physiological basis, not just psychological**
* Author's realization of the importance of facing reality and learning from patients in understanding trauma.

### TRAUMA AND THE LOSS OF SELF

* Study at VA aimed to understand why some veterans broke down after Vietnam experience
* Most veterans went to war well-prepared, formed close bonds with comrades
* **Tom's story**: friend Alex was killed in ambush, left feeling helpless and traumatized**
* Flashbacks of ambush recurred, triggered by sounds, smells, or images
* **Tom's rage led him to commit unspeakable acts of revenge**
* Trauma makes it difficult to engage in intimate relationships
* **Shame about actions during trauma is a common experience for veterans and victims**

**Tom's Experience**

* Close friendship with Alex before ambush
* Helpless during ambush, saw friend's death
* Recurring flashbacks of ambush and its aftermath
* Rage led to violent acts against civilians
* Impossible to go home again due to shame and guilt

**Shame and Trauma**

* Shame about actions during trauma is common
* Difficulty confronting own behavior during traumatic episode
* Sarah Haley's article on discussing atrocities committed during war experiences
* Deep-rooted shame for feelings of terror, dependence, excitement, or rage
* Confusion about difference between love and terror, pain and pleasure

**Impact of Trauma**

* Difficulty trusting self or others after trauma
* Intimacy becomes a challenge due to shame and guilt
* Trauma survivors may feel like part of themselves has been destroyed
* **Lifeline for traumatized people**: trust and courage to remember and confront shame.

### NUMBING

**Tom's Symptoms:**

* Emotional numbness
* Distant from family and self
* Felt like living behind a glass wall
* Could not recognize himself
* Lack of purpose or direction
* Intense involvement in particular cases brought him to life

**Effects of Intense Involvement:**

* Felt fully alive
* Nothing else mattered
* Relief from aimlessness and demons

**Tom's Coping Mechanisms:**

* Working
* Drinking
* Drugging
* Avoiding confrontation with demons
* Fantasizing about becoming a mercenary
* Riding his Harley

**Case of Defending a Mobster:**

* Total absorption in the case
* Intense strategy devising
* Stayed up all night to immerse himself
* Felt alive and purposeful
* Return of demons and numbness after winning the case
* Terrifying to be alone

**Tom's Struggles:**

* Desperately wanted to love family but couldn't feel deep emotions
* Lack of recognition of self
* Intense involvement in cases brought relief from aimlessness and demons
* Coping mechanisms included work, substances, and distractions
* Return of demons after intense involvement ended
* Fear of being alone with demons.

### THE REORGANIZATION OF PERCEPTION

**The Reorganization of Perception: Trauma and Imagination**

* **Study on trauma's effect on perception and imagination**
* **Participant**: Bill, a former medic who experienced heavy action in Vietnam
* Post-traumatic reactions after his wife gave birth to their first child
* Diagnosed as psychotic by medical professionals due to auditory and visual hallucinations
* **Misdiagnosis based on textbooks describing symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia**
* Bill's symptoms triggered by feelings of displacement in his wife's affections
* Researcher, intrigued by diagnosis, asked Bill about his experiences
* Bill described traumatic memories and flashbacks
* Rorschach test used to observe how people construct mental images from ambiguous stimuli

**Bill's Flashback during the Rorschach Test**

* First time witnessing a veteran's flashback
* Bill saw a child being blown up in Vietnam in the inkblot
* **Panic and physical sensations similar to original trauma**
* Realized the agony veterans face with unpredictable flashbacks

**Impact of Trauma on Imagination**

* Flashbacks can be worse due to their unpredictability
* **Rorschach tests revealed traumatized people's altered perception**
* Sixteen veterans saw wartime trauma in inkblots
* Five veterans saw nothing, lacking mental flexibility
* Imagination is essential for quality of life and hope for a better future
* **Trauma affects imagination by limiting mental flexibility**

**Trauma and Perception: A Fundamental Difference**

* **Normal response to ambiguous stimuli**: use imagination to read something into it
* **Traumatized people have trouble deciphering what's going on around them**
* Trauma alters perception, making the world appear differently
* Importance of understanding trauma's impact on perception and imagination for effective treatment.

### STUCK IN TRAUMA

**Trauma and Veterans**

* Clinic saw increase in veterans seeking help due to mental health issues
* Shortage of qualified doctors led to long waiting lists
* Sharp increase in violent offenses, drunken brawls, and suicides among veterans

**Starting a Group for Vietnam Veterans**

* **First session**: Veteran refused to discuss war
* Long silence followed by intense discussion of traumatic experiences
* Renewed sense of comradeship and belonging in the group
* Members insisted doctor be part of their unit, gave Marine captain's uniform

**Limitations of Group Therapy**

* Veterans had difficulty discussing daily life issues
* Preferred to relive traumatic experiences instead
* Trauma became their sole source of meaning and full aliveness
* Could not help veterans bridge the gap between past and present
* Trauma was their only source of meaning and full aliveness.

### DIAGNOSING POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS

**Diagnosing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**

- In early days at VA, veterans diagnosed with various disorders and ineffective treatments applied
- Labeling veterans with diagnoses like alcoholism, depression, etc., failed to help and sometimes worsened their condition
- **Turning point came in 1980 when PTSD was created as a diagnosis for symptoms common among veterans**
- Identifying symptoms led to understanding of patient suffering and research on effective treatments

**Background: Pre-PTSD Era**

- VA focused on treating conditions other than PTSD, with limited success
- Trauma victims' memories didn't fade or transform into benign stories
- Grant proposal for studying biology of traumatic memories rejected
- Unwilling to continue working in an organization that disregarded PTSD, resigned and took a position at Massachusetts Mental Health Center

**Impact on New Job: Psychopharmacology**

- Sensitized to trauma impact, listened differently to patients with depression and anxiety
- Discovered high prevalence of sexual abuse among female patients
- Textbook underestimated incidence and impact of incest
- Patients with incest histories had similar symptoms as veterans with PTSD

**Prevalence of Trauma**

- About a quarter of soldiers in war zones develop serious posttraumatic problems
- More Americans experience violent crimes than soldiers serving in war zones
- 12 million women in the US have been raped
- 3 million children reported as victims of child abuse and neglect each year
- For every soldier, ten children are endangered at home

**Impact on Children**

- Difficult for growing children to recover when source of terror is caretakers
- High prevalence of trauma among the population, especially children
- PTSD not limited to soldiers in war zones

### A NEW UNDERSTANDING

**A New Understanding of Trauma**

- Since meeting Tom in the 1990s, significant progress has been made in understanding trauma and its effects.

**Impact and Manifestations of Trauma**

- **Brain imaging shows damage inflicted by trauma.**
- Essential for understanding and repair.
- Trauma results in a reorganization of how mind and brain manage perceptions.
- Affects sensations and relationship to physical reality.
- Not just an event, but an imprint with ongoing consequences.
- **Trauma is not just an event from the past; it leaves an imprint on mind, brain, and body with ongoing consequences.**

**Understanding the Healing Process**

- Helping victims tell their story is important but not enough.
- Body needs to learn danger has passed and live in present reality for true healing.
- **For lasting change, the body needs to learn that danger has passed and live in the present reality.**

## CHAPTER 2
### REVOLUTIONS IN UNDERSTANDING MIND AND BRAIN

- In the late 1960s, author witnessed transition in mental health treatment at Massachusetts Mental Health Center (MMHC)
- Author worked as an attendant on research ward for young schizophrenia patients
- **Goal of research**: Determine if psychotherapy or medication was best treatment
- **Talking cure (Freudian psychoanalysis) primary treatment, but chlorpromazine (Thorazine) discovered in 1950s as alternative**
- Chlorpromazine tranquilized patients, reducing agitation and delusions
- **Drugs offered hope for treating various mental problems like depression, anxiety, mania, and schizophrenia symptoms**
- Author had no role in research, focused on organizing activities for patients
- **Patients were college students with severe mental issues**: suicide attempts, self-harm, irrational behavior**

**Author's Role and Experiences on the Ward**

- Author worked as attendant, organizing activities for young schizophrenia patients
- Patients had attempted suicide or engaged in self-harm, irrational behavior
- Attendants kept patients involved in normal college student activities
- Author attended ward meetings to understand patients' speech and logic
- Dealt with irrational outbursts and terrified withdrawal
- Learned about conditions like catatonia, but no clear solution provided by doctors or textbooks.

### TRAUMA BEFORE DAWN

**Childhood Trauma**

* **Author spent many nights on psychiatric unit, heard patients' stories of childhood trauma and family violence**
* Doctors rarely discussed these experiences during rounds
* **Dispassionate approach to patients' symptoms and lack of attention to their lives and motivations**
* Studies show over 50% of psychiatric patients have experienced assault, abandonment, or neglect as children
* Stories of physical and emotional abuse by parents, relatives, classmates, neighbors

**Questions about Hallucinations and Memories**

* Are hallucinations just concoctions of sick brains?
* Can people make up physical sensations they've never experienced?
* What is the line between creativity and pathological imagination?
* Research shows that abuse survivors may experience sensations with no obvious physical cause, hear voices

**Patient Behaviors and Trauma**

* Patients engaged in violent, bizarre, self-destructive behaviors when frustrated or misunderstood
* Author's realization of the impact of force-feeding on Sylvia
* **Rule for students**: Consider if actions towards patients replicate past traumas

**Patient Observations**

* Patients were clumsy and physically uncoordinated
* Conversations lacked natural flow of gestures and facial expressions
* Relevance of body-based therapies in understanding trauma and its effects on the body.

### MAKING SENSE OF SUFFERING

**Training at MMHC (1960s)**

* Famous psychiatrists trained there, including Eric Kandel and Allan Hobson
* Focus on patients and their suffering
* Elvin Semrad as a great teacher, discouraging textbooks and emphasizing acknowledging reality

**Shift in Approach to Human Suffering (1968-1970s)**

* Study showing schizophrenic patients benefited more from drugs than therapy
* Gradual change from viewing human suffering as infinitely variable expressions of feelings and relationships to a brain-disease model
* Many psychiatrists embraced the pharmacological revolution, becoming "real scientists"
* Major textbook of psychiatry stated cause of mental illness is a chemical imbalance

**Pharmacological Revolution (1970s)**

* First chief resident in psychopharmacology at MMHC
* Administered lithium to manic-depressive patient, first in Boston
* Part of the first U.S. research team to test antipsychotic Clozaril on chronic patients
* Amazing results led to optimism about conquering human misery
* Reduction in number of people living in mental hospitals

**Development of Research Diagnostic Criteria and DSM-III (1970s-1980)**

* Scientists developed techniques for measuring hormones and neurotransmitters
* Evidence of abnormal levels of norepinephrine associated with depression, dopamine with schizophrenia
* Hope of developing drugs targeting specific brain abnormalities
* Researchers needed a precise way to communicate findings, leading to the creation of Research Diagnostic Criteria and DSM-III.

### INESCAPABLE SHOCK

**Traumatic Stress and Neuroscience**
* Attended American College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP) meetings in 1984
* Heard a presentation by Steven Maier and Martin Seligman on learned helplessness in animals
* **Dogs subjected to "inescapable shock" became immobile and unresponsive when given chance to escape**
* Similarities between traumatized dogs and human patients
* **Traumatized people may give up and not take action to escape fear**
* Maier and Seligman's research on stress hormones in traumatized animals
	+ Large amounts of stress hormones secreted after danger has passed
	+ Ideally, stress hormone system should return to equilibrium but fails in PTSD patients
	+ **Continued secretion of stress hormones leads to agitation, panic, and long-term health issues**
* Maier's research offered potential keys to resolving traumatized patients' issues
* Repeatedly dragging traumatized dogs out of cages helped them learn to escape
* **Question**: Can traumatized people benefit from physical experiences to restore a sense of control?**
* Animal studies on mice, rats, cats, monkeys, and elephants
	+ Mice return home regardless of safety
	+ Traumatized people may seek refuge in what is familiar
	+ Question: Is it possible to help traumatized people become attached to safe and pleasurable places?

### ADDICTED TO TRAUMA: THE PAIN OF PLEASURE AND THE PLEASURE OF PAIN

* Mark Greenberg and author observed trauma survivors seeking out dangerous or painful experiences despite feelings of horror and grief
* Traumatized individuals may feel empty or bored without anger, duress, or dangerous activities (Julia's case)
* **Attractors**: things that draw us, motivate us, make us feel alive**
* Normally attractors make us feel better, but some people are attracted to dangerous or painful situations
* Richard Solomon's study on fear and pain becoming thrilling experiences
* Body adjusts to stimuli, leading to enjoyment and craving (marathon running, parachute jumping)
* **Endorphins play a role in paradoxical addictions**
* Beecher's observation of soldiers not requesting morphine due to strong emotions possibly explained by release of endorphins
* **Reexposure to stress might provide relief from anxiety for traumatized individuals**

**Mark Greenberg and author's observations in therapy groups for Vietnam combat veterans:**
- Traumatized individuals seem to come alive when talking about traumatic experiences
- Many complain of emptiness and boredom without anger or danger

**Patient Julia:**
- Brutally raped at age sixteen, got involved with violent pimp
- Repeatedly jailed for prostitution but always went back to her pimp
- Completed rehab program but returned to dangerous relationships

**Freud's theory of "compulsion to repeat":**
- Unconscious attempt to gain control and lead to mastery and resolution
- No evidence for this theory, repetition leads to further pain and self-hatred

**Attractors:**
- Things that draw us, motivate us, make us feel alive
- Normally attractors make us feel better
- Some people are attracted to dangerous or painful situations

**Richard Solomon's study on fear and pain becoming thrilling experiences:**
- Body adjusts to stimuli, leading to enjoyment and craving
- Endorphins play a role in paradoxical addictions

**Beecher's observation of soldiers not requesting morphine:**
- Strong emotions can block pain
- Reexposure to stress might provide relief from anxiety for traumatized individuals.

### SOOTHING THE BRAIN

**Soothing the Brain**

* **1985 ACNP meeting**: Jeffrey Gray's talk about amygdala and serotonin
* Amygdala determines threat perception based on serotonin levels
* Low serotonin = hyperreactive, high serotonin = less reactive
* Social environment interacts with brain chemistry
* **Monkeys**: dominance hierarchy affects serotonin levels
* Implications for traumatized people
* **1985**: L-tryptophan experiment (disappointing results)
* **Prozac, a new drug to increase serotonin levels, released in 1988**
* **Young woman with bulimia**: dramatic improvement after taking Prozac
* **Chronically depressed mother**: improved and enjoyed family time
* Study on Prozac's effects on PTSD (64 participants)
	+ Trauma Clinic patients: significant improvement
	+ Combat veterans at VA: no effect
* **Most pharmacological studies on veterans have shown limited benefits or no effect**
* Medications like Prozac, Zoloft, Celexa, Cymbalta, and Paxil contribute to trauma-related disorders treatment
* **Rorschach test data**: SSRIs give PTSD patients a sense of perspective and control over impulses.**

### THE TRIUMPH OF PHARMACOLOGY

**Impact of Pharmacology on Psychiatry**

* **Revolutionized psychiatry:** Offered doctors greater efficacy, income, and prestige.
* **Brain-disease model:** Widely accepted theory that mental illness is caused by chemical imbalances in the brain.
* **Displacement of therapy:** Drugs have allowed patients to suppress problems without addressing underlying issues.
* **Antidepressants:** Can provide relief and help with functioning, but should be considered adjuncts to therapy.
* **Downside of psychiatric medications:** May deflect attention from dealing with underlying issues.
* **Antipsychotics:** Top-selling drugs with questionable effectiveness and serious downsides.
* **Children and psychiatric medications:** At risk of becoming obese, developing diabetes, and being overprescribed antipsychotics.
* **Funding for nondrug treatments:** Rarely funded or published in mainstream medical journals.

**Consequences of the Drug Revolution**

* Increasing use of psychiatric medications has not reduced hospital admissions for depression.
* One in ten Americans now take antidepressants, with tripled hospitalizations for depression over two decades.
* Antipsychotics are top-selling drugs, with billions spent on them annually.
* Medicaid spends more on antipsychotic medications than any other class of drugs.
* Children are four times as likely to receive antipsychotics if they're from low-income families.
* Drug overdoses involving a combination of psychiatric and pain medications continue to rise.
* Mainstream medicine is committed to a better life through chemistry, marginalizing nondrug treatments.

### ADAPTATION OR DISEASE?

**Adaptation or Disease?**

* **Brain-disease model overlooks four fundamental truths**:
  **Capacity to heal**:
    * Capacity to destroy and heal one another
    * Restoring relationships and community essential for restoring well-being
  **Power of language**:
    * Gives power to change ourselves and others
    * Helps define experiences and find common meaning
  **Self-regulation**:
    * Ability to regulate physiology through basic activities
      * Breathing, moving, touching
  **Changing social conditions**:
    * Creating safe environments for children and adults to thrive
* **Ignoring these dimensions of humanity**:
  * Deprives people of ways to heal from trauma
  * Separates suffering people from community
  * Alienates them from inner sense of self
* **Limitations of drugs**:
  * Natural ways to help people deal with post-traumatic responses explored

**Fundamental Truths**

1. Capacity to destroy and heal one another
2. Restoring relationships and community essential for restoring well-being
3. Power of language to change ourselves and others
4. Ability to regulate our own physiology
5. Changing social conditions to create safe environments

## CHAPTER 3 
### LOOKING INTO THE BRAIN: THE NEUROSCIENCE REVOLUTION

- In the early 1990s, brain-imaging techniques opened up new opportunities to understand brain processing and mapping the circuits of mind and consciousness.
- Technologies like Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enabled scientists to visualize brain activation during tasks or memories.
- Neuroimaging transformed our understanding of trauma by allowing researchers to study brain activity during flashbacks.

**Harvard Medical School and the Neuroscience Revolution**

- In 1994, Scott Rauch was appointed as the first director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Neuroimaging Laboratory.
- Researchers aimed to study brain activity during flashbacks using neuroimaging techniques.

**Studying Flashbacks with Neuroimaging**

- Participants were asked to recall traumatic memories and a safe scene for comparison.
- Scripts were created to re-create the trauma moment by moment.
- Participants listened to the scripts while in an fMRI scanner, which monitored brain activity through changes in oxygen consumption.

**Case Study: Marsha's Experience**

- Marsha, a forty-year-old schoolteacher, experienced a traumatic event thirteen years prior that resulted in the death of her daughter and fetus.
- **Hearing the script of the traumatic event caused increased heart rate and blood pressure, indicating brain activation similar to the original event.**
- The neutral script did not cause any physiological response.

**Results: Brain Activation during Trauma Recall**

- Large red spot in the right lower center of the brain (limbic area or emotional brain) showed significant activation.
- Activation was primarily in the amygdala, which is known to respond to intense emotions and trigger stress response.
- **The study demonstrated that traumatized people's amygdalas react with alarm when presented with trauma-related stimuli, even years after the event.**

### SPEECHLESS HORROR

- **Significant decrease in Broca's area in left frontal lobe during trauma**
- Broca's area is a speech center; damage leads to inability to put thoughts and feelings into words
- **Trauma causes speechlessness, as shown in Macbeth's "horror! horror! horror!" quote**
- People may scream, call for help, shut down, or struggle to speak after traumatic experiences

**Brain Activity During Trauma**

- Broca's area deactivates during flashbacks
- **Surprise finding**: Brodmann's area 19 (visual cortex) activates long after trauma
- Raw images registered in area 19 are usually rapidly diffused to other brain areas for interpretation
- Trauma causes unprocessed sense fragments to be registered separately from the story itself
- **Flashbacks bring back unmodified sensations, including haunting images**

### SHIFTING TO ONE SIDE OF THE BRAIN

- **Two distinct halves with different functions**: right and left
- **Differences between the two**: intuitive vs. logical, emotional vs. analytical

**Right Brain**

- Intuitive, emotional, visual, spatial, tactual
- Stores memories of sound, touch, smell, emotions
- Communicates through facial expressions, body language, singing, swearing, crying, dancing, mimicking
- Develops first in the womb and handles nonverbal communication between mothers and infants
- Processes past experiences as intuitive truth
- Stores memories differently than left brain

**Left Brain**

- Linguistic, sequential, analytical
- Remembers facts, statistics, vocabulary of events
- Enables speaking, understanding language, comparing, and communicating experiences to others
- Processes past experiences logically
- Deactivated during flashbacks in trauma victims
- Controls executive functioning (organizing experience into logical sequences, identifying cause and effect)

**Impact of Trauma on Brain Hemispheres**

- **Trauma can deactivate left hemisphere**
- **Loss of executive functioning**: difficulty organizing experiences, identifying cause and effect, creating coherent plans for the future
- Right brain reacts to past traumatic events as if they were happening in the present
- **Trauma victims may not be aware they are reexperiencing and reenacting the past**
- After emotional storm passes, trauma victims may blame others for their behavior

### STUCK IN FIGHT OR FLIGHT

* **Marsha's experience in the scanner:** Thirteen years after her daughter's death, sensations from the accident activated her alarm system, causing a physiological response as if the tragedy was happening again.
* **Fight or flight response:** Increased adrenaline led to dramatic heart rate and blood pressure increases. Traumatized people have prolonged stress hormone responses and heightened reactions to mildly stressful stimuli.
* **Effects of prolonged stress hormones:** Memory and attention problems, irritability, sleep disorders, and long-term health issues.
* **Denial response:** Some people ignore the emotional response to a threat but still experience physical effects and increased stress hormones.
* **Neurochemical imbalance:** Marsha may be suffering from a biochemical imbalance that can be treated with drugs or a combination of drugs.
* **Hypersensitization:** Marsha's memories are highly sensitive, and desensitization through therapy could help her realize that "that was then and this is now."
* **Difficulty conveying trauma experience:** People who have experienced trauma find it challenging to put their internal experience into words.
* **EMDR treatment:** Three years after participating in the study, Marsha came to see the author as a patient and was successfully treated with Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR).

## PART TWO. THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON TRAUMA. 
## CHAPTER 4 
### RUNNING FOR YOUR LIFE: THE ANATOMY OF SURVIVAL

- Five-year-old Noam Saul witnessed the September 11 attacks from his classroom near the World Trade Center.
- He and his family ran to safety -- Noam drew a picture of the disaster with an added "trampoline" for future safety.

**Two critical aspects of adaptive response to threat:**

1. **Active role in survival:** Noam's ability to run away from the disaster allowed him to take control and be an agent in his own rescue.
2. **Integration of new experiences:** Once safe, Noam was able to make sense of what happened and imagine a creative solution.

**Trauma vs. Adaptive Response:**

- Traumatized people become stuck, unable to integrate new experiences into their lives.
- **PTSD**: body continues to defend against past threat, affecting the entire organism (body, mind, brain).
- Healing from PTSD involves terminating continued stress mobilization and restoring the organism to safety.

**Effects of Trauma:**

- Focus on suppressing inner chaos at the expense of spontaneous involvement in life.
- **Physical symptoms**: fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, autoimmune diseases.
- **Critical for trauma treatment to engage the entire organism (body, mind, brain).**

### ORGANIZED TO SURVIVE

**Brain's Alarm System**

- Triggers preprogrammed physical escape plans in oldest brain parts
- Direct connection between brain and body
- Old brain takes over, shuts down higher brain (conscious mind)
- Propels body to run, hide, fight, or freeze

**Fight/Flight/Freeze Response**

- Ends threat when effective action is taken
- Immobilization keeps body in state of shock and learned helplessness
- Stress hormones fuel resistance and escape
- Brain and body programmed to return to safety

**Effects of Trauma**

- **Elevated stress hormone levels can cause ongoing fear, depression, rage, physical disease**
- Normal response may be blocked in certain situations (war zone, car accident, domestic violence, rape)
- Brain continues sending signals to body to escape non-existent threat

**Recognition of Trauma**

- Recognized since 1889 by French psychologist Pierre Janet
- Survivors may continue "attempt at action" long after event
- Critical factor in determining long-term effects of traumatic experience

**Brain's Response to Trauma**

- Vast network of interconnected parts organized for survival and flourishing
- Understanding brain's response essential for resolving traumatic stress

### THE BRAIN FROM BOTTOM TO TOP

* **Brain's primary job**: ensuring survival and coordinating group living
* **Essential functions**:
  * Generate internal signals for needs (food, rest, protection, etc.)
  * Create a map of the world
  * Generate energy and actions
  * Warn of dangers and opportunities
  * Adjust actions based on requirements

**Brain Development and Structure**

* Brain develops level by level in fetus and evolution
* **Three main parts**: 
  - rational brain
  - emotional brain (reptilian and limbic systems)
  - body housekeeping functions

**Emotional Brain (Reptilian and Limbic Systems)**

* Oldest part of the brain
* Responsible for basic survival functions
* Located in brainstem and hypothalamus
* **Controls energy levels, heart and lungs, endocrine and immune systems**
* Develops in use-dependent manner (neuroplasticity)
* Shapes emotional and perceptual map of the world
* Influences small and large decisions
* Initiates preprogrammed escape plans (fight or flight responses)

**Rational Brain**

* Youngest part of the brain
* Occupies about 30% of the skull
* Primarily concerned with understanding the external world
* Develops after birth and throughout childhood
* **Enables language, abstract thought, planning, and reflection**
* Allows for culture creation and unique human abilities

### MIRRORING EACH OTHER: INTERPERSONAL NEUROBIOLOGY

**Discovery of Mirror Neurons (1994)**

- Italian scientists identified specialized cells in monkey's cortex
- Fired when monkey watched actions, not just performed them
- Explained empathy, imitation, synchrony, language development
- "Neural WiFi," pick up others' emotions and intentions

**Effects of Mirror Neurons**

- People tend to mimic each other in body language and voice rhythms
- Vulnerable to others' negativity
- Trauma often involves lack of being seen, mirrored, or taken into account

**Frontal Lobes**

- **Crucial for harmonious relationships with humans**
- Understanding others' motives and adapting in groups
- Flexible, active frontal lobes prevent superficial relationships
- Invention, innovation, discovery, and wonder
- Stop us from embarrassing or hurting ourselves or others

**Challenges with Frontal Lobes**

- **Impulse control**: less rational brain capacity with intense emotional input**
- Troubles begin on edge between impulse and acceptable behavior

### IDENTIFYING DANGER: THE COOK AND THE SMOKE DETECTOR

**Identifying Danger: The Role of the Cook (Thalamus) and Smoke Detector (Amygdala) in the Brain**

- *Danger is a normal part of life*
- Sensory information reaches thalamus, the "cook" within the brain
- **Thalamus blends sensations into coherent experience**

**The Low Road: Amygdala's Role in Identifying Danger**

- *Amygdala, brain's smoke detector*
- Quickly identifies threats to survival
- Processes information faster than frontal lobes
- Sends message to hypothalamus and brain stem
- Triggers stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline) release
- Prepares body for fight or flight response

**The High Road: Frontal Lobes' Role in Conscious Awareness**

- Processes information more slowly than amygdala
- Reaches conscious awareness

**Threat Detection and Misinterpretation**

- *Amygdala can misinterpret danger*
- Trauma increases risk of misinterpreting situations
- Accurately gauging people's intentions crucial for relationships and work environments
- Faulty alarm systems lead to misunderstandings or extreme reactions.

### CONTROLLING THE STRESS RESPONSE: THE WATCHTOWER

* **Amygdala as smoke detector:**
  + Triggers stress response
  + Does not make judgments
* **Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC) as watchtower:**
  + Offers objective perspective
  + Helps assess situation and inhibit stress response
* **Balance between amygdala and MPFC:**
  + Crucial for emotional control
  + PTSD: Shifted balance, difficulty controlling emotions
* **Top-down regulation:**
  + Strengthening watchtower's monitoring capacity
  + Mindfulness meditation and yoga help
* **Bottom-up regulation:**
  + Recalibrating autonomic nervous system (ANS)
  + Access through breath, movement, or touch
* **Breathing:**
  + One of few body functions under conscious and autonomic control
* **Techniques for increasing top-down and bottom-up regulation will be explored in part 5.**

### THE RIDER AND THE HORSE

- **Emotion is not opposed to reason, but foundational for it.**
- Self-experience is the balance between rational and emotional brains.
- Survival situations can cause independent functioning of emotional and rational brains.
- Comparison of relationship between rational brain and emotional brain to a rider and an unruly horse.
- Emotional brain can take control when survival is at stake or during intense emotions like fear, rage, longing, etc.
- **Psychological problems often originate from deeper regions in the brain rather than defects in understanding.**
- When emotional brain perceives a threat, pathways between it and rational brain become tenuous.
- Anger management techniques may not work during intense emotions.
- Conflict between emotional and rational brains results in physical discomfort and psychological misery.

**Brain Scans and Core Features of Traumatic Stress:**

- **Timeless reliving**: traumatic memories can be reexperienced as if they are happening in the present.
- **Reexperiencing images, sounds, and emotions**: traumatic memories can trigger strong emotional responses and sensory experiences.
- **Dissociation**: a coping mechanism where an individual disconnects from their thoughts, feelings, or surroundings during traumatic events.

### STAN AND UTE’S BRAINS ON TRAUMA

- **September 1999**: Stan and Ute Lawrence, a professional couple, were involved in the worst road disaster in Canadian history near London, Ontario.
- **Accident**: Dense fog caused a massive pileup involving 87 cars, including Stan and Ute's car. They came to a stop just before being hit by an eighteen-wheeler.
- **Aftermath**: Trapped in their car, they witnessed people dying and heard ear-splitting crashes. Eventually, they were freed and taken to the hospital with no major injuries.
- **Trauma Symptoms**: Unable to sleep, irritable, jumpy, on edge, haunted by images and questions related to the accident. Turned to wine for relief.
- **Seeking Help**: Three months after the accident, they sought help from Dr. Ruth Lanius, a psychiatrist at the University of Western Ontario.

**fMRI Scan and Treatment**

- **fMRI Scan**: Dr. Lanius wanted to use an fMRI scan to visualize Stan and Ute's brains before treatment. This non-invasive method measures neural activity by tracking changes in blood flow.
- **Flashbacks**: During the scan, Stan experienced a flashback, reliving the accident instead of remembering it as something that had happened three months earlier. His heart raced, blood pressure was high, and he sweated.
- **Treatment**: Unspecified treatment followed after the fMRI scan.

### DISSOCIATION AND RELIVING

* **Dissociation**: overwhelming trauma experiences split off and fragmented, intruding into present as sensory fragments
* Trauma replayed through flashbacks, unaware of connection to past traumatic events
* Stress hormones circulating, defensive responses repeated

**Characteristics of Flashbacks**

* Can occur at any time, without warning or end
* Exhausting and leaves people fatigued, depressed, weary
* Memories engraved deeper with each replay
* Difficulty experiencing present fully

**Triggered Responses**

* Intense and irrational reactions outside of control
* Shame and hiding the truth central preoccupation
* **Differences in responses**: some may startle, others numb or shut down
* Physical reactions detectable through lab tests

**Impact on Brain**

* Amygdala makes no distinction between past and present during flashbacks
* Normal stress hormone responses during trauma can become disruptive if overactive

**Therapy and Recovery**

* Therapy helps bring emotions generated by trauma to surface
* Gaining mastery over internal sensations and emotions key to recovery
* Sensing, naming, and identifying what's going on inside first step to recovery.

### THE TIMEKEEPER COLLAPSES

* Stan and Ute's prefrontal cortex struggled to maintain control after the accident
* Stan's flashback led to a more extreme reaction
* **Two brain systems relevant for mental processing of trauma**: emotional intensity and context

**Emotional Intensity**

* Defined by the amygdala, smoke alarm, and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)
* **Amygdala**: responsible for emotional response
* **Smoke alarm**: triggers fear response
* **MPFC**: counterweight to amygdala, regulates emotional response

**Context and Meaning**

* Determined by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus
* **DLPFC**: timekeeper of the brain, relates present experience to past and future
* **Hippocampus**: forms memories

**The Thalamus Shuts Down**

* Two white holes in lower half of brain are Stan's right and left thalamus
* Blanked out during flashback as they were during original trauma
* Functions as a "cook" or relay station for sensory information
* Breakdown explains why trauma is remembered as isolated sensory imprints
* Normally acts as a filter or gatekeeper, compromised by trauma
* People with PTSD have their floodgates wide open and are on constant sensory overload
* Try to shut down naturally or use drugs/alcohol to block out the world
* Price of closing down includes filtering out sources of pleasure and joy.

### DEPERSONALIZATION: SPLIT OFF FROM THE SELF

**Depersonalization:**

* Response to trauma where mind goes blank and brain activity decreases
* Heart rate and blood pressure don't elevate
* **Outward manifestation of dissociation created by trauma**
* Patients may tell horrendous stories without feeling
* Conventional talk therapy is virtually useless in such cases

**Ute's Experience:**

* Responded to trauma by going numb
* **Learned survival strategy in childhood to cope with harsh treatment from mother**
* Discovered she could blank out her mind when mother yelled at her
* Automatically went into same survival mode during car accident
* Challenged to become alert and engaged to recapture her life

**Approach Towards Blanked-Out Patients:**

* Conventional talk therapy is ineffective due to decreased brain activity
* Bottom-up approach essential to change patient's physiology
* **Measures include heart rate and breathing patterns, evoking bodily sensations**
* Rhythmic interactions with others effective (tossing ball, bouncing on Pilates ball, drumming, dancing)

**Impact of Depersonalization:**

* Can be more damaging than explosive flashbacks over time
* Particular problem for traumatized children who blank out and are overlooked
* Acting-out kids get attention while blanked-out ones don't, leading to loss of future.

### LEARNING TO LIVE IN THE PRESENT

- Difficulty feeling alive in the present leads to dominance of traumatic memories in PTSD

**Misconception about Trauma Treatment:**

- Many approaches focus on desensitizing patients to past traumas
- Expectation is that reexposure will reduce emotional outbursts and flashbacks

**Importance of Living Fully in the Present:**

- Focus on enhancing daily experience instead of just dealing with past traumas
- Bring back brain structures that deserted during trauma
- Desensitization may make less reactive but unable to find satisfaction in everyday activities
- Ordinary experiences like walking, cooking, or playing with kids enrich life and help move past trauma.
- **Reason for traumatic memories' dominance**: difficulty living fully and securely in the present

## CHAPTER 5 
### BODY-BRAIN CONNECTIONS

* **Charles Darwin's "The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals** (1872)

**Key Points:**

- Exploration of emotional life, filled with observations and anecdotes
- Discusses the physical organization common to all mammals
- Emotions are fundamentally rooted in biology
- Facial and physical movements communicate mental state and intention
- Emotions give shape and direction to actions
- **Origin of emotions**: initiate movement to restore organism to safety and equilibrium
- Intense emotions involve gut and heart (body-brain connections)

**Darwin's Observations:**

* Humans share physical signs of animal emotion
* Emotions are the source of motivation
* Facial and physical expressions communicate mental state and intention
* Emotions initiate movement to restore organism to safety and equilibrium
* Intense emotions involve gut and heart (body-brain connections)

**Body-Brain Connections:**

* Heart, guts, and brain communicate intimately via the 'pneumogastric' nerve
* Mind affects state of viscera under excitement
* Visceral sensations unbearable, can lead to mental health problems (drug addiction, self-injurious behavior)
* Traditional healing practices in India and China focus on body-brain connections
* Transforming our understanding of trauma and recovery today.

### A WINDOW INTO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

- **Two branches of Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)**: sympathetic and parasympathetic
- Linked to body's energy flow, managing expenditure and conservation

**Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)**

- Arousal, fight-or-flight response
- Roman physician Galen named it "sympathetic" due to its connection with emotions
- **Prepares body for action**: moves blood to muscles, triggers adrenal glands to release adrenaline

**Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS)**

- **Promotes self-preservative functions**: digestion, wound healing
- **Slows down arousal**: triggers release of acetylcholine
- Important for feeding, shelter, and mating activities

**Experiencing SNS and PNS**

- Deep breaths activate SNS (increases heart rate)
- Exhalation activates PNS (slows down heart rate)

**Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**

- Measurement of the flexibility of the arousal system
- Good HRV indicates proper functioning and balance of brake and accelerator in arousal system
- Can be used to help treat PTSD (as explained in chapter 16)

### THE NEURAL LOVE CODE

**Polyvagal Theory** **introduced by Stephen Porges in 1994**:

- Expanded understanding of safety and danger based on body's visceral experiences and social relationships
- Named for the many branches of vagus nerve connecting brain, organs, and social interactions
- Explained how kind faces or soothing voices can alter feelings and improve regulation
- Clarified importance of being seen and heard in maintaining safety and calming effects of focused attunement
- Highlighted role of social relationships in understanding trauma and new approaches to healing

**Key Points about Human Beings:**

- Highly attuned to emotional shifts in others through mirror neurons and facial expressions
- Our faces give others clues about our emotions and arousal levels
- We function as members of a tribe, with most energy devoted to connecting with others
- Mental suffering often involves relationship issues or arousal regulation difficulties

**Implications:**

- Social relationships are crucial for safety, healing, and mental wellbeing
- Focus on understanding and addressing relationship problems and arousal regulation can be more effective than searching for specific drugs to treat symptoms."

### SAFETY AND RECIPROCITY

* **Jerome Kagan's observation**: every act of cruelty outweighed by hundreds of small acts of kindness and connection
* Being able to feel safe with others is crucial for mental health and satisfying lives
* Social support is essential protection against stress and trauma
* **Reciprocity is key**: being truly heard and seen by people around us
* Physiological healing requires a visceral feeling of safety
* No prescription for friendship and love, complex and hard-earned capacities
* Focusing on shared trauma may provide solace but promotes further alienation
* Well-functioning people accept individual differences and acknowledge humanity of others
* Animals like dogs, horses, and dolphins offer less complicated companionship and sense of safety for some trauma patients.

**Social Support:**

* Most powerful protection against stress and trauma
* **Not just being in the presence of others, but reciprocity**: feeling truly heard and seen**
* Numerous studies on disaster response around the world

**Trauma:**

* Can lead to isolation and denial of individual differences
* Focusing on shared trauma may provide solace but promotes further alienation
* **Gangs, extremist political parties, religious cults may offer solace but hinder mental flexibility**

**Animals as Companions:**

* Offer less complicated companionship and sense of safety for some trauma patients
* Extensively used to treat trauma patients with dogs, horses, and dolphins.

### THREE LEVELS OF SAFETY

[????]

### FIGHT OR FLIGHT VERSUS COLLAPSE

* **Mammalian Fight-or-Flight System:** protective, keeps us engaged in present
	+ Characterized by playfulness and huddling in animals
	+ Activated in response to sudden threat
	+ Decreases responsiveness to human voice and increases sensitivity to threatening sounds
	+ Makes people feel energized
* **Reptilian Brain:** produces collapse response
	+ Characterized by immobilization and unresponsiveness
	+ Engages when fight or flight does not take care of threat
	+ **Controlled by DVC, an ancient part of parasympathetic nervous system**
		- Associated with digestive symptoms like diarrhea and nausea
		- Slows down heart and induces shallow breathing
		- Shuts down awareness and may cause lack of physical pain registration.
* **Examples of fight or flight**: road rage, intense impulse to move and attack
* **Examples of collapse**: shutting down and becoming dead to the world, feeling numb in safe situations
* Collapse is a last resort when physically immobilized or no escape from threat.

### HOW WE BECOME HUMAN
- **Vagus Nerve Complex (VVC) evolution in mammals for complex social life**
  * Mating, nurturing young, defending, coordinating hunting and food acquisition
  * Efficiently synchronizes sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems

**Infant Development**

- Newborns not very social, at mercy of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems
- **Parental interactions stimulate growth of synchronicity in VVC**
  * Helps bring emotional arousal systems into sync with surroundings
  * Controls sucking, swallowing, facial expression, larynx sounds
  * Creates foundation for social behavior and sense of pleasure and safety

**The Brain as a Cultural Organ**

- Attuned interactions between mother and child continue throughout life
- Synchrony in various activities fosters deep sense of pleasure and connection

**Trauma and the VVC**

- Trauma occurs when VVC fails to respond appropriately
  * Immobilization leads to DVC takeover
  * Heart slows, breathing becomes shallow, dissociation and loss of self-awareness ensue"

### DEFEND OR RELAX?

**Defensive System and Emotional Connection**

- Natural state of mammals: somewhat on guard (Steve Porges)
- To feel emotionally close: defensive system must temporarily shut down
- Brain needs to turn off vigilance for play, mating, nurturing

**Effects of Trauma**

- Hypervigilant or numb: unable to enjoy pleasures or respond to danger
- Malfunctioning smoke detectors in the brain
- Increased risk of violence and abuse for traumatized individuals (ACE study)

**Intimacy and Safety**

- **ACE Study findings**:
  - Women with early abuse/neglect 7x more likely to be raped
  - Witnessing mother's assault increases chance of domestic violence
- **Deep intimacy requires allowing immobilization without fear**
- **Challenges for traumatized people**:
  - Discerning safety and activating defenses when necessary
  - Restoring sense of physical safety (topic to be covered in later chapters)

### NEW APPROACHES TO TREATMENT

- Traumatized individuals get stuck in fight/flight or chronic shut-down.
- **To help them deactivate defensive maneuvers**:
  - Create small, safe places for social engagement.
  - Engage emotional-engagement system before promoting new ways of thinking.

**Steve Gross's Approach:**

- Used brightly colored beach ball to engage traumatized children.
- Gradually created back-and-forth interaction, leading to smiles and relaxation.

**Importance of Engaging Emotional System:**

- Humans respond to playful tones with opening up and relaxing.
- Yelling can lead to further dysregulation.
- Educational system often bypasses emotional engagement.

**Polyvagal Theory:**

- Helped explain why unconventional techniques work in trauma treatment.
- Combines top-down (social engagement) with bottom-up (calming body).

**Effective Therapeutic Techniques:**

- Yoga, theater programs, karate, play techniques, sensory stimulation.
- Breath exercises, chanting, martial arts, drumming, group singing, and dancing.

**Body Keeps the Score:**

- Trauma memory encoded in viscera and emotions.
- Mind/brain/visceral communication is crucial for emotion regulation.
- Demands a radical shift in therapeutic assumptions.

## CHAPTER 6 

### LOSING YOUR BODY, LOSING YOUR SELF

* Sherry Grew up in a foster home with transient children
* Mother emotionally abused her, making her feel unwanted
* Graduated from college, worked clerical job, lived alone with cats, no close friends
* Experienced kidnapping and rape in college

**Effects of Emotional Abuse and Neglect:**

* Devastating, especially for young children
* Can be as damaging as physical or sexual abuse
* Leads to disconnection from self and others
* May result in maladaptive coping mechanisms

**Sherry's Coping Mechanisms:**

* Picking at skin for relief from numbness and shame
* Previously hospitalized involuntarily, questioned about suicidal behavior
* Felt disconnected from therapists, unable to form vital connections

**Discovering the Relevance of the Body:**

* Sherry's extreme disconnection from her body
* Importance of understanding the living, breathing body as foundation of self
* Therapy focusing on insight and understanding had ignored body's role

**Help for Sherry:**

* Suggested seeing a massage therapist, Liz
* First session resulted in panic when Sherry lost sense of Liz's presence
* Helped Sherry reconnect with her body and self.

### LOSING YOUR BODY

**McFarlane's Research:**

- Studied how we recognize objects by touch in Adelaide, Australia.
- Requires sensing shape, weight, temperature, texture, and position.
- **People with PTSD often struggle to integrate these sensory experiences.**

**William James' Case Study:**

- Woman reported having "no human sensations."
- Could not feel objects she touched or experience enjoyment.
- Felt a void in the front of her head and a diminished sensibility over her body.

**Implications for PTSD:**

- Trauma can lead to sensory insensibility and inability to feel secure and complete in one's body.
- **Important question**: How can traumatized people learn to integrate ordinary sensory experiences?

### HOW DO WE KNOW WE’RE ALIVE?
* **Ruth Lanius posed new question**: What happens in the brains of trauma survivors when they are not thinking about the past?
* Studied "default state network" (DSN) or idling brain
* **Normal subjects showed activation of midline structures involved in self-awareness:**
  * Posterior cingulate (internal GPS)
  * Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC, watchtower)
  * Insula (relays messages from viscera to emotional centers)
  * Parietal lobes (integrates sensory information)
  * Anterior cingulate (coordinates emotions and thinking)
* **Chronic PTSD patients with severe early-life trauma showed no activation of self-sensing areas**:
  * MPFC, anterior cingulate, parietal cortex, insula
  * Deadened capacity to feel fully alive
* **Implications for loss of sense of purpose and direction, inability to recognize oneself in a mirror**
* Need to reactivate self-sensing system.

### THE SELF-SENSING SYSTEM

- Sherry's massage therapy improved her life, making her more relaxed and open
- Met Antonio Damasio, who clarified the relationship between body states, emotions, and consciousness
- Damasio's work focuses on identifying areas of the brain responsible for self-awareness

**The Divide Between Self and Body Sensations**

- Our sense of self hides inner body states, preventing us from sensing our true selves
- Primordial feelings provide direct experience of body states and are the foundation of self-awareness

**Pre-Natal and Post-Natal Development of Bodily Sensations**

- We feel sensations in the womb and after birth that define our relationship to ourselves and surroundings
- Physical sensation continues to provide crucial feedback on moment-to-moment condition throughout life

**The Role of Consciousness in Maintaining Inner Equilibrium**

- Our conscious self plays a vital role in registering and acting on physical sensations to keep bodies safe
- Subcortical regions of the brain regulate basic functions, but can become overwhelmed by threats
- Proto-self refers to housekeeping areas of the brain that create wordless knowledge underlying conscious sense of self

### THE SELF UNDER THREAT

* In 2000, Damasio et al. published an article in Science about the brain's response to reliving negative emotions

**Brain changes during emotional recall:**
- Significant changes in brain areas receiving nerve signals from muscles, gut, and skin
- Distinct patterns for each emotion
- Brain stem involved in sadness and anger, but not happiness or fear

* Expressions link emotions with body
  - "You make me sick"
  - "It made my skin crawl"
  - "I was all choked up"
  - "My heart sank"
  - "He makes me bristle

Elementary self system in brain stem and limbic system

**Threat of annihilation:**
- Overwhelming sense of fear and terror
- Intense physiological arousal
- People reliving trauma are trapped in life-or-death situation

**Symptoms:**
- Startle easily
- Frustrated by small irritations
- Chronically disturbed sleep
- Food loses sensual pleasures
- Desperate attempts to shut feelings down

**Regaining control when animal brains are in fight or survival mode**

- **Subcortical brain structures:**
  - Orchestrate body sensations
  - Limited control over them?
- **Shutting down feelings:**
  - Desperate attempts to freeze and dissociate.

### AGENCY: OWNING YOUR LIFE

**Agency:** feeling in charge of one's life, knowing where one stands, having a say in what happens

* **Interoception:** awareness of subtle body-based feelings; essential for controlling one's life
* **Mindfulness practice:** strengthens the MPFC, helps observe inner experiences and manage them
* **Trauma:** can shut down inner compass, rob imagination to create something better
* **Neuroscience of selfhood and agency:** validates somatic therapies
* **Sensorimotor approaches:** draw out blocked sensory information, help befriend energies released by trauma, complete self-preserving physical actions
* **Gut feelings:** signal what is safe or threatening, help evaluate outer environment
* **Traumatized people:** chronically feel unsafe inside their bodies, ignore or suppress inner warning signs
* **Fear of fear:** develop a fear of bodily sensations associated with panic attacks
* **Self-regulation:** depends on having a friendly relationship with one's body
* **Somatic symptoms:** ubiquitous in traumatized children and adults, no clear physical basis, can include chronic pain, digestive problems, asthma, etc.
* **Traumatized children:** have fifty times the rate of asthma as non-traumatized peers
* **Somatic symptoms:** not aware of having breathing problems before fatal asthma attacks.

### ALEXITHYMIA: NO WORDS FOR FEELINGS

**Symptoms:**

* Difficulty identifying feelings
* Appearing emotionless or detached
* Experiencing physical symptoms instead of emotional responses
* Trouble sensing body signals
* Lack of nuanced response to frustration
* Reluctance to acknowledge and process emotions

**Causes:**

* Trauma history
* Suppression of feelings for survival
* Disconnection between mind and body

**Effects:**

* Difficulty with intimacy and relationships
* High rates of revictimization
* Lack of self-protection
* Remarkable difficulties feeling pleasure, sensuality, and having a sense of meaning

**Brain Scans:**

* Less activity in self-sensing areas of the brain for those out of touch with feelings
* Contributes to lack of nuanced response to frustration and difficulties processing emotions.

### DEPERSONALIZATION

* **Depersonalization**: losing sense of self
* Illustrated by Ute's brain scan in chapter 4, appearing blank
* Common during traumatic experiences
* **Author's personal experience**: mugging, feeling detached and curious
* **Schilder's description (1928)**: strange, foreign, dream-like perception of the world
* Objects appear altered in size or flat, sounds come from a distance
* Emotions altered, unable to feel pain or pleasure
* Neuroscientists at University of Geneva induced out-of-body experiences by stimulating temporal parietal junction
* Patients reported feeling detached from body, hanging from ceiling or having someone behind them
* Confirms patients' reports that self can be detached and live as phantom existence
* **Lanius and Frewen, University of Groningen**: brain scans showed fear centers shut down during recall of traumatic events.

### BEFRIENDING THE BODY

**Trauma Recovery**

- Trauma victims cannot recover until they befriend their bodies and become aware of sensations
- Fear, anger, and child abuse victims have tense, defensive bodies
- Importance of physical self-awareness to release past trauma

**Exploring Internal World of Sensations:**

- Notice and describe physical sensations beneath emotions
- Identify sensations associated with relaxation or pleasure
- Pay attention to subtle shifts in body during negative events

**Dealing with Distressing Physical Reactions:**

- Noticing sensations for the first time can be distressing, may cause flashbacks
- Therapist must help prevent retraumatization
- Medications like Abilify, Zyprexa, and Seroquel only blunt sensations

**The Power of Touch:**

- Human beings naturally calm themselves through touch
- Trauma victims crave touch but are terrified of it
- Mind needs to be reeducated to feel physical sensations
- Body needs to be helped to tolerate and enjoy comforts of touch

**Emotional Awareness:**

- Individuals who lack emotional awareness can connect physical sensations to psychological events
- Gradually reconnect with oneself

### CONNECTING WITH YOURSELF, CONNECTING WITH OTHERS

- **Study on the cost of losing body connection**: what happens in chronically traumatized people during face-to-face contact?
- **Ruth Lanius' research**: brain activation differences between normal controls and survivors of chronic trauma during eye contact
  - **Expensive device used**: video character approaching at direct gaze or averted gaze
  - **Normal controls**: prefrontal cortex (PFC) activated, assessing person and curiosity
  - **Survivors of PTSD**: no PFC activation, intense activation in Periaqueductal Gray, self-protective behaviors
- Implications for relationships and therapy
  - Ability to experience others as separate individuals with motivations and intentions
  - Need to stand up for oneself while recognizing others' agendas
  - Trauma can make these abilities hazy and gray.

## PART THREE. THE MINDS OF CHILDREN. 
## CHAPTER 7 
### GETTING ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH: ATTACHMENT AND ATTUNEMENT

- The Children's Clinic at Massachusetts Mental Health Center was filled with disturbed children who were wild, clingy, oppositional, and had difficulty exploring or playing.
- Researchers Nina Fish-Murray and Bessel van der Kolk aimed to understand the differences between traumatized and non-traumatized children using projective tests.
- They used Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) cards with realistic but ambiguous scenes, asking children to tell stories about what's happening in the photos.
- A study was conducted comparing twelve traumatized children from the clinic with a control group of non-traumatized children.
- Traumatized children had experienced severe abuse within their families, including physical and sexual abuse.
- Control children also lived in poverty and witnessed violence but responded differently to the cards, imagining benign outcomes.
- Traumatized children's responses were alarming, revealing intense feelings of danger, aggression, sexual arousal, and terror.
- The children's worldview was filled with triggers, making anyone or anything a potential harbinger of catastrophe.
- Staff discussions at the clinic focused on diagnostic labels instead of addressing the underlying trauma.
- **Challenges**: Understanding resilience in normal children and helping traumatized children redraw their inner maps with trust and confidence.

### MEN WITHOUT MOTHERS

**MEN WITHOUT MOTHERS:** A study on the importance of the mother-infant relationship initiated by upper-class Englishmen who experienced early separation from their mothers due to boarding schools.

* **English psychiatrists**: John Bowlby, Wilfred Bion, Harry Guntrip, Ronald Fairbairn, and Donald Winnicott
* Early experiences shape later connections with others and self-concept
* "Me-search" in psychology
* Inspired by their own experiences of separation from mothers
* Boarding school experiences may have influenced George Orwell's 1984

**John Bowlby:**

* Born into an aristocratic family
* Educated at Cambridge University and trained in psychology, medicine, and psychoanalysis
* Worked with delinquent boys in London's East End
* Observed effects of wartime evacuations, group nurseries, and hospitalization on children
* Claimed children's disturbed behavior was due to actual life experiences rather than infantile sexual fantasies
* Radical claim led to being ostracized from British psychoanalytic community
* Developed attachment theory

**Impact of Early Separation:**

* Inspired research on mother-infant relationship
* Shaped these men's perspectives and work in psychology
* Orwell's 1984 may have been influenced by their experiences
* Children's behavior affected by neglect, brutality, and separation."

### A SECURE BASE

**Secure Base and Attachment**

- Humans are profoundly social creatures who learn self-care from early interactions with caregivers
- **Importance of harmonious early interactions for mastering self-regulation and developing healthy ways of responding to people**
- Children are captivated by faces and voices, sensitive to nonverbal cues, and form primary attachment bonds with responsive adults
- **Attachment bond creates a secure base for children to explore the world**
- Research supports the importance of having a safe haven for promoting self-reliance, empathy, and social skills

**Early Interactions and Child Development**

- Infants are sensitive to facial expressions, posture, tone of voice, physiological changes, tempo of movement, and incipient actions
- Children choose one or a few adults for primary attachment bonds
- Responsive adults deepen the attachment bond and promote healthy development
- **Inconsistency in caregiver attention can make children nervous and disrupt their sense of security**

**Impact of Attachment on Childhood and Beyond**

- Secure base provides self-awareness, empathy, impulse control, and self-motivation for social interaction
- Lack of these qualities was observed in kids at Children's Clinic.

### THE DANCE OF ATTUNEMENT

* Attachment develops between children and primary caregivers
* **Secure attachment forms through emotional attunement**
* Attunement starts at physical levels, giving babies a feeling of being met and understood
* **Infants learn imitation as a fundamental social skill**
* Attunement includes emotional synchrony and physical synchrony
* **Disruptions in attunement can lead to distress and repair**
* Secure attachment leads to self-regulation, self-soothing, and self-nurture
* **Parents teach children to manage arousal and regulate emotions**
* Securely attached children learn agency and difference between controllable and uncontrollable situations
* **Insecure attachment from abuse or neglect can lead to learned helplessness**

**Emotional Attunement:**
- Starts at subtle physical levels
- Gives babies a feeling of being met and understood
- Develops secure attachment

**Attunement and Synchrony:**
- Infants imitate behavior of parents, teachers, and peers
- Physical and emotional synchrony between infant and caregiver

**Disruptions and Repair:**
- Disruptions can lead to distress
- Caregivers repair the relationship through soothing actions

**Secure Attachment:**
- Foundation for self-regulation, self-soothing, and self-nurture
- Children learn what makes them feel good and bad
- Acquire a sense of agency
- Learn difference between controllable and uncontrollable situations

**Insecure Attachment:**
- Can lead to learned helplessness
- Children learn that their actions have no effect on caregiver's response.

### BECOMING REAL

* **Donald Winnicott** and his studies on attunement**:
* Focused on the importance of physical interactions between mothers and infants in developing a sense of self and identity
* **Proposed that "good enough mothering" is essential for healthy development**
* Physical attunement lays the foundation for feeling the body as the place where the psyche lives
* **Lack of physical attunement can lead to children perceiving something is wrong with themselves, shutting down feedback from their bodies, and becoming vulnerable to emotional issues**

* **Secure attachment**:
  * Majority of children are securely attached due to reliable, responsive caregiving
  * Helps maintain emotional security throughout life and forms a template for relationships
  * Securely attached children pick up on others' feelings, learn to tell reality from games, and develop good interpersonal skills

* **Impact of abuse or neglect**:
  * Children may become defensive, scared, and sensitive to threats
  * May shut down or lose control of impulses, leading to social isolation and further emotional issues

* **Need for attachment**:
  * Humans cannot tolerate disengagement from others for long periods
  * People find other ways to bond when unable to connect through work, friendships, or family

* **Case study**:
  * Fourteen-year-old boy named Jack, repeatedly arrested for burglaries
  * Felt irrelevant and unconnected, seeking attention and recognition even through criminal activities.

### LIVING WITH THE PARENTS YOU HAVE

* **Living with Parents:** Children have a biological instinct to attach; coping styles based on attempts to get needs met

**Secure Attachment:**

* Distressed when mother leaves
* Delighted when she returns
* Settle down and resume play

**Avoidant Attachment:**

* Infants seem unaffected by separation
* Chronically increased heart rates
* Mothers have trouble showing affection
* Infants "deal but don't feel

**Anxious or Ambivalent Attachment:**

* Infants constantly seek attention
* Derive little comfort from mother's return
* Focused on mother even in other children's presence
* Anxious toddlers grow into anxious adults
* Avoidant toddlers become out of touch with feelings

**Disorganized Attachment:**

* Unable to engage with caregivers
* Caregivers are a source of distress or terror
* Children cannot choose between seeking closeness and avoiding parent
* "Fright without solution"

**Assessment:**

* Mary Ainsworth's Strange Situation research tool
* Securely attached infants return to play contentedly after mother leaves
* Insecure attachments have more complex reactions

**Consequences:**

* Persist into adulthood
* Anxious adults may become bullies or victims
* Disorganized attachment children may trust nobody or be intensely affectionate with strangers.

### BECOMING DISORGANIZED WITHIN

**Attachment Research:**

* Conscientious parents may worry about occasional impatience or lapses in attunement affecting their kids
* Infants often left to calm themselves, not a problem within limits
* "Good enough" caregivers allow for repair of broken connections
* Critical issue is feeling viscerally safe with parents or caregivers

**Attachment Patterns:**

* **Secure**: 62% of infants in normal middle-class environments
* **Avoidant**: 15%
* **Anxious (ambivalent)**: 9%
* **Disorganized**: 15%
* Gender and temperament have little effect on attachment style
* Children from lower socioeconomic groups more likely to be disorganized

**Effects of Disorganized Attachment:**

* Trouble regulating moods and emotional responses as they grow older
* Aggressive or disengaged behavior in kindergarten
* Range of psychiatric problems
* **Biological dysregulation may not reset to normal**

**Causes of Disorganized Attachment:**

* Parental abuse
* Parents preoccupied with their own trauma (domestic abuse, rape, recent death)

**Misattunement and Chronic Disconnection:**

* Misunderstandings and failures in communication are common
* **Misattunement can lead to chronic disconnection**
* Mothers who fail to calm baby down may perceive child as difficult and give up on comforting

**Intertwined Problems:**

* Difficult to distinguish problems from disorganized attachment and trauma
* Upbringing leaves children with vulnerable physiology, making it hard to regain equilibrium after traumatic experiences

**Parental Stress and Child Reactions:**

* Children's reactions to painful events determined by parents' calmness or stress
* Secure attachment predicts less painkiller requirement for hospitalized children
* Mothers' PTSD or depression increases child's risk of emotional problems and hyperaggression
* Fathers' PTSD affects children indirectly through mothers

**Self-Perceptions and Trauma:**

* Disorganized people may carry self-perceptions that make them more susceptible to trauma
* Feeling chronically numbed out or expecting others to treat them poorly increases risk of being traumatized.

### THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF DISORGANIZED ATTACHMENT

* Research by Karlen Lyons-Ruth in the 1980s
* Focused on mothers and infants from high-risk families
* **Two types of disorganized attachment**:
  * Mothers who were intrusive and hostile
    * Preoccupied with their own issues
    * Inconsistent and unpredictable behavior
    * History of physical abuse or domestic violence
  * Mothers who were helpless and fearful
    * Sweet or fragile demeanor
    * Unable to be the adult in the relationship
    * History of sexual abuse or parental loss (but not physical abuse)
* **Disorganized attachment led to**:
  * Increasingly frustrating interactions between mother and child
  * Mothers viewing children as strangers
  * Setting the stage for subsequent abuse
* **Follow-up study when children were around twenty years old**:
  * Infants with disrupted emotional communication patterns at eighteen months
    * Unstable sense of self
    * Self-damaging impulsivity (excessive spending, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating)
    * Inappropriate and intense anger
    * Recurrent suicidal behavior
* **Surprising findings**:
  * Emotional withdrawal had the most profound impact on adult children's mental instability
  * Emotional distance and role reversal linked to aggressive behavior against self and others.

### DISSOCIATION: KNOWING AND NOT KNOWING

**Dissociation:** feeling lost, overwhelmed, disconnected from the world, unloved, empty, helpless, trapped, and weighed down.

**Relationship between Maternal Disengagement and Dissociative Symptoms:**
- Infants not truly seen and known by mothers at high risk for dissociation in early adulthood (Lyons-Ruth)
- **Secure relationships**: infants communicate needs, emerging selves, receive sympathetic response
- Maternal neglect or hostility leads to anticipation of rejection, coping through dissociation

**Bowlby's Perspective:**
- What cannot be communicated to mother cannot be communicated to self
- Inability to tolerate what is known or feel feelings leads to denial and dissociation
- Lack of feeling real inside makes it impossible to protect oneself, may result in extreme behaviors

**Early Learning of Dissociation:**
- Dissociative symptoms learned early, not solely caused by later abuse or trauma (Karlen's research)
- **Critical underlying issue**: lack of safety and impaired sense of inner reality
- Treatment needs to address consequences of not being mirrored, attuned to, and given consistent care and affection.

### RESTORING SYNCHRONY

**Early attachment patterns shape our relationships throughout life, influencing what we expect and experience in terms of comfort and pleasure**

* **Importance of early experiences:**
  * e.e. cummings' joyous lines likely influenced by positive early experiences
  * Realization of past experiences may not directly lead to healing but can help explore new ways to connect
* Attachment maps are implicit, etched into emotional brain and not easily reversible
* Damaged attunement systems can be healed through training in rhythmicity and reciprocity (discussed in Part 5)

**Being in synch:**
  * **Requires integration of body-based senses**: vision, hearing, touch, balance
  * **Importance of sensory rhythms**: cooking, cleaning, going to bed/waking up
  * Sharing activities like funny faces, hugs, tossing balls, singing together
* Trauma Center programs focus on coaching parents in connection and attunement
* **Other ways to foster synchronicity**: choral singing, ballroom dancing, joining teams, etc.

## CHAPTER 8 
### TRAPPED IN RELATIONSHIPS: THE COST OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT

- **Marilyn**: operating-room nurse in her midthirties, athletic, played tennis with Boston fireman named Michael
- Invited him to stay over one evening, felt "uptight and unreal"
- Fell asleep together, woke up to Michael touching her, exploded in rage
- Attacked Michael, screamed, humiliated and hated herself
- Came to therapy for help with terror of men and rage attacks

**Therapy Process:**

- Therapist listens without trying to fix the problem immediately
- **Inexplicable behaviors common in therapy**:
  * Attacking a boyfriend
  * Feeling terrified when someone looks you in the eye
  * Covered with blood after cutting yourself
  * Deliberately vomiting up every meal
- Takes time and patience for reality behind symptoms to reveal itself

### TERROR AND NUMBNESS

**Marilyn's Background:**

* Marilyn, a nursing degree holder, shared her experiences of feeling numb and losing control when spending time alone with men.
* She had a violent confrontation with her alcoholic father at age sixteen and ran away from home.
* Her childhood memories are vague before the age of twelve.
* She's harboring terrible memories but cannot recognize them.
* Marilyn has drawn a family portrait revealing a wild and terrified child trapped in a cage, threatened by nightmarish figures and a huge erect penis.

**Therapy Approach:**

* Marilyn joined an established therapy group for support and acceptance before facing her distrust, shame, and rage.
* The group's intrusive questions about her love life reminded her of past traumas.
* Marilyn was diagnosed with lupus erythematosus of her retina, an autoimmune disease eroding her vision.

**Study Findings:**

* Collaboration between psychiatrist, immunologist, and research team to study incest survivors' immune system response.
* Twelve women with incest histories and twelve non-traumatized women participated in the study.
* Incest survivors had a larger proportion of RA cells (memory cells) ready to pounce compared to non-traumatized peers.
* The oversensitive immune system in incest victims makes it difficult for their bodies to distinguish between danger and safety, with the imprint of past trauma affecting not only their minds but also their core beings.

### A TORN MAP OF THE WORLD

**Understanding the Impact of Child Abuse and Neglect**

- People learn about safety, self, and relationships based on childhood experiences
- **Marilyn's story**: Egocentric view of the world shaped by abuse and neglect
  * Self-perception marked by contempt and humiliation
  * Distrustful of others, especially men and women
  * Suspicious of kindness, blames herself for mistreatment

**Inner Map of the World**

- Shaped by earliest caregivers' interactions
  * Conveys what is safe and dangerous
  * Forms template of self and world perception
- Stable across time but can be modified by experience
  * Deep love relationships during adolescence or birth of a child
  * Adults who were abused or neglected can still learn intimacy and trust
- Distorted maps due to adult rape or assault may lead to terror or despair

**Recognizing and Changing Inner Maps**

- People like Marilyn discover their assumptions are not the same as others
  * Friends and colleagues may tell them in words, but rarely do
- Vulnerability to activating old maps when feeling trapped, enraged, or rejected
- Change begins by learning to "own" emotional brains
  * Observe and tolerate heartbreaking sensations
  * Befriend emotions instead of obliterating them

### LEARNING TO REMEMBER

- **Marilyn's group**: members share traumatic experiences for empathy and understanding
  * Mary shares experience of rape and abortion at age 13
  * Group offers comfort and empathy
- Marilyn's revelation of her own trauma
  * Trauma involved dissociation, fear system activation, and lack of story
- **Therapy for dealing with past traumas**
  * Calming techniques: deep breathing, acupressure points, mindfulness
  * Recognizing present from past experiences
- Marilyn's memories begin to surface
  * Flashbacks of wallpaper in childhood bedroom
  * No protection or support from parents during abuse
- **Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome**
  * Initiation, intimidation, stigmatization, isolation, helplessness, and self-blame
  * Adult conspiracy of silence and disbelief
- **Common reactions to childhood trauma**
  * Disbelief, shame, self-blame, and denial
  * **Dissociation**: making oneself disappear during traumatic experiences.

### HATING YOUR HOME

**Children:**

* No choice in parents or home environment
* Cannot understand or talk about abuse due to loyalty and fear
* Exhibit enraged, shut down, compliant, or defiant behavior
* Cling to abusers despite danger

**Effects of Childhood Abuse:**

* Loneliness, despair, self-hatred, and helplessness
* Inability to trust
* Difficulty distinguishing reality from imagination (soul murder)
* Erasing awareness and cultivating denial for survival.

**Adult Survivors:**

* Struggle with trust and identity
* May exhibit similar behaviors as children, such as clinging to abusers or hiding abuse.

### REPLAYING THE TRAUMA

**Trauma and Childhood Memories**

- Marilyn's childhood trauma resurfaced in a choking dream
- Dream reminded her of war veterans' nightmares with unadulterated images and sensations
- During therapy, Marilyn was flooded with fragments of the traumatic experience
  * Sitting in kitchen as a four-year-old with injuries and being mocked by family
  * Brushing teeth and feeling panicked and unable to breathe
- Trauma not stored as a narrative with beginning, middle, and end
- Memories return as flashbacks with isolated images, sounds, and body sensations
- Marilyn had no way to give voice to the unspeakable during childhood
- Survivors of childhood abuse exemplify the power of the life force and will to live
- Healing trauma requires acknowledgement and awe for survivors' dedication to survival

## CHAPTER 9 
### WHAT’S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT?

**Complex mental health issues:**

- Receive multiple, unrelated diagnoses
- **Mood swings**: bipolar disorder
- **Despair**: major depression
- **Restlessness and lack of attention**: ADHD
- **Trauma history**: PTSD
- No diagnosis fully describes patients' experiences or identities

**DSM:**

- First systematic manual of psychiatric diagnoses (1980)
- Warned insufficiently precise for forensic settings, insurance purposes
- Insurance companies require DSM diagnosis for reimbursement
- Academic programs organized around DSM categories
- Virtual industry earning APA over $100 million

**Consequences of misdiagnosis:**

- Disastrous effects on treatment
- Profound influence on self-perception and identity
- Patients seen as out-of-control, needing to be "straightened out"

### HOW DO YOU TAKE A TRAUMA HISTORY?

- Started collaborating with Judith Herman in 1985
- Both interested in trauma's impact on patients diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)

**Trauma History Interview: The Traumatic Antecedents Questionnaire (TAQ)**

- Designed interview instrument to uncover childhood trauma without asking point-blank questions
- Gradual progression from simple to revealing questions
- Asked about current relationships and childhood relationships, safety, rules, discipline, and disagreement solutions
- Many patients reported traumatic experiences, including abuse, neglect, and violence
- Realized that BPD issues may have started as coping mechanisms for overwhelming emotions and inescapable brutality

**Findings from the Study**

- 81% of BPD patients at Cambridge Hospital reported severe histories of child abuse and/or neglect
- Impact of abuse depends on age at which it begins
- Later research supported findings, but some studies still focus on particular horrendous events instead of long-term effects

**Implications for Treatment**

- Understanding the language of trauma and abuse is crucial to understanding BPD
- Children's feelings of anger, guilt, fear, and inner conflict are often a result of experiences rather than counterreactions
- Chronic distrust, inhibition of curiosity, distrust of senses, and tendency to find everything unreal can be consequences of disowned experiences.

### SELF-HARM

**Self-Harm**

- Woman came to hospital three nights in a row with self-inflicted neck injuries
- Told the author she felt better after harming herself
- Author wondered why some people cope with upsetting situations differently

**Study Findings**

- History of childhood sexual and physical abuse linked to repeated suicide attempts and self-cutting
- Suicidal thoughts may start in early childhood
- Inflicting harm on oneself could be a desperate attempt for control

**Patient Outcomes**

- After three years of therapy, approximately two-thirds of patients had improved
- Patients who remained self-destructive lacked memories of feeling safe as children
- Lack of deep memory of feeling loved and safe may result in underdeveloped brain receptors for human kindness

**Implications for Therapy**

- Importance of attuned relationships and feeling safe in therapy for those who lack memories of safety in childhood
- Question of how to help people learn to calm themselves down and feel grounded in their bodies (to be explored further in Part 5)

### THE POWER OF DIAGNOSIS

* The study identified a distinct population of traumatized individuals, different from combat soldiers and accident victims
* These individuals, such as Marilyn, Kathy, and children with abuse histories, do not necessarily remember their traumas but continue to behave as if they're in danger
* They have trouble concentrating, staying on task, and negotiating relationships, among other symptoms
* **A field trial was conducted under Robert Spitzer's guidance to compare trauma symptoms in different populations: childhood abuse, domestic violence, and natural disasters**
* Results showed clear differences between groups, particularly those with childhood abuse histories
* Symptoms included trouble concentrating, being on edge, self-loathing, relationship difficulties, memory gaps, self-destructive behaviors, and medical problems
* **The study suggested creating a new diagnosis for victims of interpersonal trauma: "Disorders of Extreme Stress, Not Otherwise Specified" (DESNOS) or "Complex PTSD"**
* The diagnosis was not included in the DSM-IV publication despite being overwhelmingly approved by the work group
* **Lack of diagnosis creates a dilemma for therapists, forcing them to diagnose with conditions that don't fully address the patients' needs**
* Consequences of caretaker abuse and neglect are more common and complex than natural disasters or accidents but were ignored in the diagnostic system.

### THE HIDDEN EPIDEMIC

**Discovery of the Connection between Childhood Trauma and Obesity:**
- Vincent Felitti, chief of Kaiser Permanente's Department of Preventive Medicine in San Diego, discovered that many morbidly obese patients had a history of childhood sexual abuse.
- A nurse aide who lost weight through his program regained it due to the attention of a male coworker and her past traumatic experiences.
- Felitti presented this finding at a meeting of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity, but faced skepticism from some experts.

**The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study:**
- In 1990, Felitti collaborated with Robert Anda and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct a larger study on adverse childhood experiences.
- The study involved interviewing over 25,000 Kaiser patients about their childhood experiences and comparing the results with their medical records.

**Findings of the ACE Study:**
- **Prevalence of Adverse Childhood Experiences:** More than one-third of respondents reported no adverse experiences, but more than a quarter reported physical abuse, and over 20% reported sexual abuse or neglect.
- **Impact on Health in Adulthood:** People with higher ACE scores (indicating more adverse childhood experiences) had higher rates of chronic depression, workplace absenteeism, financial problems, lower lifetime income, and increased likelihood of substance abuse, suicide attempts, and risky sexual behavior.
- **Interrelatedness of Adverse Experiences:** The study found that incidents of abuse are rarely standalone events; instead, they are interconnected.

**Health Consequences of Childhood Trauma:**
- **Mental Health:** Chronic depression in adulthood is more common among those with higher ACE scores.
- **Substance Abuse:** People with an ACE score of four were seven times more likely to be alcoholic, and the likelihood of IV drug use increased exponentially for those with higher scores.
- **Suicide Attempts:** The risk of suicide attempts increases exponentially as the ACE score rises.
- **Violence:** Abused or neglected girls are at much higher risk of being raped later in life, and boys who witness domestic violence are more likely to abuse their own partners.
- **Health Problems:** People with an ACE score of six or above had a greater chance of currently suffering from any of the ten leading causes of death in the United States.

**Implications:**
- The ACE study highlights the importance of addressing childhood trauma as a public health issue and its long-term impact on individuals' lives.
- Understanding the interconnectedness of adverse experiences can help inform prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate their effects."

### WHEN PROBLEMS ARE REALLY SOLUTIONS

- Felitti saw a woman who had undergone bariatric surgery but became suicidal after losing weight
- Obesity may be a personal solution for some, not a problem to eliminate
- **Weight can provide protection and safety for individuals**:
  - Woman felt overlooked as an overweight person
  - Guards in prison felt safer being the biggest guy on the cellblock
  - Male patient gained weight as a means of feeling safe from violence
- Adaptations such as smoking, drinking, drugs, obesity are difficult to give up due to short-term benefits
- **ACE study group concluded**:
  - Long-term health risks may be personally beneficial in the short term
  - The presenting problem is often a marker for the real problem
  - Real problem lies buried in time, concealed by patient shame, secrecy, and sometimes clinician discomfort.

### CHILD ABUSE: OUR NATION’S LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM

- **Robert Anda's discovery at CDC**: child abuse is the most costly public health issue in the US
- Costs exceed those of cancer or heart disease
- **Eradicating child abuse would reduce**: depression by more than half, alcoholism by two-thirds, suicide, IV drug use, and domestic violence by three-quarters
- Improve workplace performance and decrease incarceration needs

**Impact of ACE Study:**

- Revealed the gravest public health issue in the US
- Calculated overall costs exceeded those of cancer or heart disease
- Reduction in depression, alcoholism, suicide, drug use, and domestic violence if child abuse is eradicated
- Dramatic effect on workplace performance and decreased need for incarceration

**Comparison to Smoking and Health Campaign:**

- Surgeon General's report on smoking and health in 1964 led to decades-long campaign
- Number of American smokers fell from 42% to 19% between 1965 and 2010
- Prevented nearly 800,000 deaths from lung cancer between 1975 and 2000

**Current Reality:**

- Follow-up studies and papers continue to appear
- Day-to-day reality of children in outpatient clinics and residential treatment centers remains the same
- High doses of psychotropic agents given instead, impairing emotional and intellectual growth and contributing membership to society.

## CHAPTER 10 
### DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA: THE HIDDEN EPIDEMIC.

* Hundreds of thousands of children with traumatic backgrounds absorb significant resources without noticeable improvement
* Children end up in jails, welfare rolls, and medical clinics as statistics
* Professionals and taxpayers fund their care

**Anthony's Story:**

* Referred to Trauma Center at age 2.5 for biting, pushing, refusal to nap, and constant crying
* Anxiously clung to mother, hid face, and started head banging when pushed away
* Mother had a history of abandonment, abuse, and violent relationships
* **Diagnosed with various psychiatric disorders**: depression, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety, reactive attachment disorder, ADHD, and PTSD
* Felt scared and fought for survival, did not trust mother's help

**Maria's Story:**

* Fifteen-year-old Latina in foster care with a history of abuse and multiple placements
* Diagnosed as mute, vengeful, impulsive, reckless, self-harming, with extreme mood swings and explosive temper
* Described herself as "garbage, worthless, rejected"
* Placed in equine therapy program where she felt safe and formed a connection with her horse
* Graduated from high school and accepted into college

**Virginia's Story:**

* Taken away from biological mother due to drug abuse
* Moved from foster home to foster home before being adopted again
* Described as isolated, controlling, explosive, sexualized, intrusive, vindictive, and narcissistic
* Diagnosed with bipolar disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, reactive attachment disorder, ADD, ODD, and substance use disorder
* Felt disgusting and wished to be dead

**The Challenge:**

* Correctly define the issues these children face
* Find ways to help them lead productive lives
* Save taxpayers' money by addressing root causes
* Focus on facts instead of developing new drugs or finding a single "gene" responsible for their "disease"

### BAD GENES?

**Genetics and Mental Illness**

* Pervasive problems in families lead to belief in "bad genes" as cause of mental illness
* Thirty years of research on schizophrenia's genetic causes have failed to yield consistent results
* **Genes do not produce fixed results, but are influenced by life events and methylation**
* **_Epigenetics_**: life events can change gene behavior, which can be passed on to offspring

**Schizophrenia Research**

* Affects about 1% of population, severe, runs in families
* Thirty years of research, millions spent, no consistent genetic patterns found

**Genes and Multiple Outcomes**

* Many genes work together to influence a single outcome
* Genes are not fixed; life events can change their behavior through methylation

**Epigenetics**

* Life events can modify gene behavior by attaching methyl groups
* Methylation patterns can be passed on to offspring
* McGill University research on rat pups and mothers:
  * Intensive licking and grooming affects brain chemicals, gene expression, and hippocampus development
  * Lasts throughout the rat's life and affects stress response and learning ability

**Human Epigenetics**

* Stressful experiences can affect gene expression in humans
* Quebec ice storm study: epigenetic changes in children of mothers trapped in unheated houses
* Social class differences associated with distinct epigenetic profiles, but abused children share specific modifications in seventy-three genes.

### MONKEYS CLARIFY OLD QUESTIONS ABOUT NATURE VERSUS NURTURE

* Stephen Suomi's research on rhesus monkeys (95% human gene similarity) for over 40 years
* **Two consistent personality types identified**: 
  - uptight, anxious monkeys 
  - highly aggressive monkeys
* Biological differences **detected within the first few weeks of life** in arousal levels, stress hormones, and brain chemistry metabolism
* Social environment significantly influences behavior and biology

**Uptight Monkeys:**

* Lack social support as adults, often neglect or abuse firstborns
* Can provide protection under stable social conditions
* Peer-raised monkeys become uptight with attachment issues and overreact to stress

**Aggressive Monkeys:**

* Punitive mothers, infants lack peer friendships
* No social advantages

**Impact of Environment on Genes:**

* Monkeys with short serotonin transporter alleles (associated with impulsivity, aggression, depression)
* Raised by adequate mother: normal behavior and no deficit in serotonin metabolism
* Raised with peers: aggressive risk-takers
* Human research supports the importance of safe early relationships for children's development
* Parents with genetic vulnerabilities can still protect their children with support.

### THE NATIONAL CHILD TRAUMATIC STRESS NETWORK

**The National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN)**

- Established by an act of Congress in 2001
- Dedicated to research and treatment of traumatized children
- Previously, no comprehensive organization for childhood trauma
- Conceived due to interest from Nathan Cummings Foundation
- Lack of systematic education on childhood trauma
- Affects mental, biological, or moral development
- Trauma in children different from adults
- Collaborative network of 17 sites grew to over 150 centers
- Includes universities, hospitals, tribal agencies, etc.
- Over 8,300 affiliated partners

**Background and Formation**

- Call from Adam Cummings, Nathan Cummings Foundation
- Discussion on effects of trauma on learning
- No forum for implementing discoveries
- Convened think tank with representatives from various departments and organizations
- Agreed on need for national organization promoting study and education
- Bill drafted by Bill Harris and Senator Kennedy's staff
- Overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate

**Children and Developmental Trauma Disorder (DTD)**

* Single traumatic incidents can cause basic PTSD symptoms in children.
* Children with histories of abuse and neglect have less obvious traumatic roots for their behaviors.
* Many receive pseudoscientific diagnoses like oppositional defiant disorder or disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.
* Needed a diagnosis that captured the reality of their experience: Developmental Trauma Disorder (DTD).

**Characteristics of DTD**

* Pervasive pattern of dysregulation
* Problems with attention and concentration
* Difficulties getting along with themselves and others
* Rapidly shifting moods and feelings
* Physical problems: sleep disturbances, headaches, unexplained pain, oversensitivity to touch or sound
* Self-harming activities (masturbation, rocking, biting, cutting)
* Difficulties with language processing and fine-motor coordination
* Clinging and needy behavior towards abusers
* Sense of defectiveness and worthlessness
* Difficulty making friends

**Rejection of DTD Proposal**

* Matthew Friedman, executive director of the National Center for PTSD, believed no new diagnosis was required.
* Claimed that clinical intuition about early childhood adverse experiences cannot be backed up by prospective studies.
* Several prospective studies were included in the proposal.

### HOW RELATIONSHIPS SHAPE DEVELOPMENT

**How Relationships Shape Development: Insights from the Minnesota Longitudinal Study**

- Alan Sroufe and colleagues studied 180 children and families from 1975 to 2004 (Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation)
- Debate on nature vs. nurture, temperament vs. environment, and trauma were not initial focuses
- Recruited Caucasian mothers who qualified for public assistance with various backgrounds and support levels
- Assessed children's major aspects of functioning and significant life circumstances from birth to age 28

**Questions Addressed:**

1. How do children learn to regulate arousal and impulses?
2. What supports do they need, and when?
3. Role of quality of care and biological factors

**Findings:**

- No single factor (mother's personality, infant's neurological anomalies, IQ, or temperament) predicted behavioral problems in adolescence
- Parent-child relationship was the key issue
- Vulnerable infants with inflexible caregivers led to clingy, uptight kids
- Insensitive, pushy, and intrusive parental behavior at six months predicted hyperactivity and attention problems
- Caregivers help children develop their own arousal regulation abilities
- Consistent caregiving produced well-regulated kids; erratic caregiving led to chronically aroused kids
- Early neglect or harsh treatment led to behavior problems in school, lack of empathy for others, and vicious cycle of rejection and punishment

**Resilience:**

- Security established with primary caregiver during first two years crucial for coping with life's disappointments
- Highly lovable kids at age 2 predicted resilience in adulthood.

### THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF INCEST

**Frank Putnam and Penelope Trickett's Research (1986)**

* First longitudinal study on impact of incest on female development
* Recruited 84 sexually abused girls, matched with 82 non-abused girls
* Assessed six times over 20 years, starting at age 11
* **Results**: Sexually abused girls suffer from various negative effects

**Negative Effects:**

* Cognitive deficits
* Depression
* Dissociative symptoms
* Troubled sexual development
* High rates of obesity and self-mutilation
* Higher dropout rate from high school
* More major illnesses, healthcare utilization
* Abnormalities in stress hormone responses
* Earlier onset of puberty
* Multiple psychiatric diagnoses

**Impact on Development:**

* Lack of friends before and after puberty
* Difficulties with trust, self-esteem, and biology
* Inability to keep up in social skills development
* Isolation and early sexual maturation
* Increased levels of testosterone and androstenedione

**Consequences:**

* **Numbing**: suppressed reactions to distress
* Lack of protective action
* Difficulties forming healthy relationships
* Impulsive behavior, lack of self-protection
* Viewing helpers as frightening and intrusive

**Implications for Clinicians:**

* Understanding the world from a traumatized perspective
* Moving beyond victim/perpetrator dynamics and labels
* Addressing the unique challenges faced by sexually abused girls.

### THE DSM-5: A VERITABLE SMORGASBORD OF “DIAGNOSES”

- Published in May 2013, includes three hundred disorders in its 945 pages
- Offers various labels for problems associated with severe early-life trauma, such as Disruptive Mood Regulation Disorder, Non-suicidal Self Injury, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, Dysregulated Social Engagement Disorder, and Disruptive Impulse Control Disorder
- **Ignores underlying causes of mental problems, focusing on surface phenomena**
- Lacks reliability and validity, according to American Journal of Psychiatry study
- British Psychological Society **criticized for overlooking social causation of many problems**
- Most striking rejection came from National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)

**NIMH's Reaction:**

- **NIMH could no longer support DSM's "symptom-based diagnosis"**
- Focused on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to study mental illness as brain disorders
- Funding exploration of brain circuits and neurobiological measures underlying mental problems
- First step towards precision medicine for mental health

**Limitations:**

- Ignores social causes of mental problems, focusing solely on brain disorders
- Overlooks the importance of relationships and social conditions in mental development

**Reactions to DSM-5:**

- Thousands of clinicians supported study of Developmental Trauma Disorder (DTD) through donations
- First results from field trials have been published, more to come as book goes to print.

### WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD DTD MAKE?

- **Focus on central principles of chronically traumatized children and adults**:
  - Pervasive biological and emotional dysregulation
  - Failed or disrupted attachment
  - Problems staying focused and on track
  - Deficient sense of coherent personal identity and competence

**Lessons from Neuroplasticity:**

- Apply neuroplasticity to rewire brains and reorganize minds of traumatized individuals
- Social support is a biological necessity for prevention and treatment

**Early Childhood Programs:**

- Quality programs that involve parents and promote basic skills in disadvantaged children
- Improve outcomes, save costs on welfare, healthcare, substance abuse, and incarceration
- **Examples**: Home-visitation programs, day care, preschool

**European Approach to Public Health:**

- Universal health care, guaranteed minimum wage, paid parental leave, high-quality childcare for all working mothers
- Lower incarceration rates and crime rates
- Fewer foster children in prison systems
- Investment in helping parents raise children in safe surroundings

**Implications:**

- Recognize profound effects of trauma and deprivation on child development
- Parents need help to nurture their kids, not blame
- Industrialized nations with strong support systems have better outcomes and lower costs

## PART FOUR. THE IMPRINT OF TRAUMA. 
## CHAPTER 11 
### UNCOVERING SECRETS: THE PROBLEM OF TRAUMATIC MEMORY

- In spring 2002, a young man named Julian claimed to have been sexually abused by Catholic priest Paul Shanley.
- He had forgotten the abuse until he heard about the investigation against the priest.
- **Question**: Were his memories credible for testimony in court?

**Historical Context: Controversies over Traumatic Memory**

- Debate on credibility of traumatic memories dates back to late 19th century.
- Psychiatrists first described unusual nature of traumatic memories.
- Passions surrounding this issue have been intense.

**Impact of Trauma on Memory**

- Traumatic experiences can lead to repressed or delayed memories.
- Memories may be fragmented, incomplete, or distorted.
- The recall process can be influenced by various factors, including emotional state and context.

### FLOODED BY SENSATIONS AND IMAGES

**Julian's Experience with Childhood Abuse**

* **February 11, 2001**: Julian recalls conversation with girlfriend about Father Shanley's suspected molestation
* Panic and flood of memories; initial denial of abuse
* Overwhelming emotions and physical symptoms (panic attacks, seizures, self-harm)
* Childhood experiences with Father Shanley
	+ Age 6: First encounter in CCD class
	+ Fondling and sexual acts
	+ Fragmented memories
	+ Self-blame and shame

**Impact of Abuse on Julian's Life**

* Popular athlete in high school, but poor student and heavy drug use
* Homeless after graduation
* Enlisted to regain control of life
* Struggles with self-image and emotional regulation
* Triggers and reenactments of abuse during sexual experiences

**Therapeutic Approach**

* Focus on tolerating emotions and reactions, not determining exact details
* Addressing self-blame and accepting trauma was not their fault

**Legal Considerations**

* Determination of culpability in legal cases
* Daubert hearing to set standards for expert testimony
* Previous research on traumatic memory and its effects on recall

### NORMAL VERSUS TRAUMATIC MEMORY

- Autobiographical memories are not precise reflections of reality, but personal stories.
- **The Grant Study of Adult Development illustrates how memories change over time.**
- Wartime memories evolve with time for most participants, except those with PTSD.
- Memories depend on personal significance and emotional arousal.
- Ordinary experiences quickly fade from memory.
- Incidents that deviate from the established pattern are more likely to be remembered.
- **Adrenaline plays a role in memory formation; higher adrenaline leads to more precise memories.**
- Traumatic experiences can overwhelm the memory system, leading to fragmented sensory and emotional traces.

**Normal Memory**

- Autobiographical memories are not exact reflections of reality.
- Memories depend on personal significance and emotional arousal.
- Ordinary experiences quickly fade from memory.
- Incidents that deviate from the established pattern are more likely to be remembered.
- Adrenaline plays a role in memory formation; higher adrenaline leads to more precise memories up to a point.

**Traumatic Memory**

- Memories of traumatic experiences are preserved essentially intact over long periods.
- Trauma leads to fragmented sensory and emotional traces instead of coherent narratives.
- High arousal disrupts collaboration between rational and emotional memory systems.
- Trauma disconnects other brain areas necessary for proper storage and integration of information, such as the hippocampus and thalamus.
- Emotional brain takes over during traumatic experiences, expressing altered activation through changes in emotional arousal, body physiology, and muscular action."

### UNCOVERING THE SECRETS OF TRAUMA

- **Late 19th century**: Mental problems, including traumatic memory, under study
- **Central topics**: "Railway spine" (psychological aftermath of railroad accidents), hysteria
- **Hysteria**: Emotional outbursts, susceptibility to suggestion, muscle contractions/paralysis
- **Early researchers**: Charcot, Janet, Freud
- Trauma as root cause of hysteria, particularly childhood sexual abuse
- **Traumatic memories**: "Pathogenic secrets" or "mental parasites"
- Hysteria investigation linked to French politics (struggle between monarchists and advocates of the French Republic)

**Jean-Martin Charcot**

- Father of neurology, studied hysteria as scientific explanation for supernatural phenomena
- **Believed women would influence struggle between old order and secular democracy**
- Studied hysteria as scientific explanation for supernatural phenomena
- Meticulous studies of physiological and neurological correlates

**Pierre Janet**
- Helped establish research lab at Salpêtrière
- **Published first book-length scientific account of traumatic stress (1889)**
- **Root cause**: Vehement emotions or intense emotional arousal
- Automatic repetition of trauma-related actions, emotions, sensations
- Primary interest in understanding patients' minds and treating them

**Significant Findings**

- Trauma as root cause of mental disorders (hysteria)
- Traumatic memories as "pathogenic secrets" or "mental parasites"
- Importance of emotional arousal in traumatic stress
- Need for understanding patients' minds and treating them
- Early studies on physiological and neurological correlates of trauma

### AMNESIA, DISSOCIATION, AND REENACTMENT

* Janet's work on traumatic memory vs. narrative memory
* Irène's case: amnesia for mother's death & compulsive reenactment
* Traumatized people remember too little and too much
* Automatism: involuntary, unconscious actions
* **Differences between ordinary and traumatic memory**
	+ Triggers precipitate traumatic memories
	+ Traumatic memory is not condensed
	+ No social function for traumatic memory
	+ Reenactments are frozen, lonely experiences
* Janet's term "dissociation": splitting off and isolation of traumatic memories
* **Cost of dissociation**: inability to integrate new experiences and decline in functioning
* PTSD: unable to put trauma behind and integrate into autobiographical memory
* **Goal of treatment for PTSD**: association, integrating cut-off elements into ongoing narrative of life."

### THE ORIGINS OF THE “TALKING CURE”


* Psychoanalysis origins at Salpêtrière, Paris (1885) under Charcot's influence
* **Freud and Breuer's 1893 paper on hysteria: traumatic memories persist, not at patient's disposal**
	+ Memories lost due to impossible reaction or severely paralyzing affects
	+ Belief in seduction of children by adults (later retracted)
* Freud's shift from seduction theory to unconscious wishes and fantasies
* Trauma and lack of verbal memory: reproduced as action, not remembered
* **"Talking Cure" origin: recollection with affect disappears symptoms, language as substitute for action**
* CBT assumption: detailed trauma story helps in leaving it behind
* Case studies: reenactment instead of remembering (cigarette girl, Vietnam veteran)
* Recognition challenge: how to identify traumatic stress when no memory is present?
* Patients risk being labeled as crazy or punished as criminals without known history.

### TRAUMATIC MEMORY ON TRIAL

**Traumatic Memory on Trial**

- **Paul Shanley, a former priest, was found guilty of raping a child and assaulting a child in 2005.**
- He was sentenced to 12-15 years in prison.
- **In 2007, his attorney filed for a new trial based on the invalidity of "repressed memory" evidence.**
- The appeal was rejected by the original trial judge but taken up by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 2009.
- Over 100 psychiatrists and psychologists signed an amicus curiae brief stating that "repressed memory" does not exist.
- The court unanimously upheld Shanley's conviction in January 2010, allowing the use of dissociative amnesia theory as evidence.

**Court Decision**

- The court found that the lack of scientific testing did not make unreliable the theory of dissociative amnesia.
- There was no abuse of discretion in the admission of expert testimony on the subject of dissociative amnesia.

## CHAPTER 12 
### THE UNBEARABLE HEAVINESS OF REMEMBERING
* **Scientific interest in trauma:** Fluctuated over the past 150 years, with Charcot's death and Freud's shift leading to neglect until World War I.
* **Effect of World War I on scientific interest in trauma:** Hundreds of thousands of soldiers with bizarre symptoms and memory loss led to renewed interest.
* **Shell shock vs. neurasthenia:** British diagnosis of shell shock entitled veterans to treatment and a pension, while neurasthenia did not.
* **British General Staff's response:** Issued General Routine Order Number 2384 in 1917, denying the existence of shell shock and labeling all soldiers with psychiatric problems as "NYDN."
* **German treatment of shell shock:** Treated as a character defect, punitive methods used.
* **British government's response:** Issued Southborough Report in 1922 to prevent diagnosis of shell shock in future wars and undermine compensation claims.
* **Fate of US veterans:** Welcomed as national heroes but denied pensions until 1945, leading to encampment on the Mall in Washington DC in 1932.
* **Denial of trauma consequences:** Played a role in the rise of fascism and militarism around the world in the 1930s.
* **Impact of World War I on literature and art:** All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque became an international best seller but was later burned by the Nazis for its awareness of trauma's effects.
* **Consequences of denying trauma:** Can lead to social fabric damage, humiliation of the powerless, and moral justification for vanquishing the inferior, ultimately contributing to the ensuing war.

### THE NEW FACE OF TRAUMA

* **World War II and the Study of Trauma**
* Charles Samuel Myers and Abram Kardiner's work with WWI soldiers and veterans published in Shell Shock in France 1914–1918 (1940) and The Traumatic Neuroses of War (1941)
* Hypnosis as the predominant treatment for war neuroses, shown in John Huston's documentary "Let There Be Light" (1946)
* **Differences in trauma expression between WWI and WWII soldiers**: physical symptoms like stomach upsets and heart races, but also verbalization of traumatic experiences
* **Culture shapes the expression of traumatic stress**: doctors focused on medical complaints instead of psychiatric ones
* Germaine Greer's account of her father's PTSD after WWII and its impact on her work
* **Disparity between young Vietnam veterans and older WWII veterans in VA treatment**: older vets communicated distress through physical symptoms, not nightmares or rage
* **Doctors influenced how patients communicated their distress**: focusing on physical problems for better care
* **Important lessons from WWII**: Marshall Plan, GI Bill, racial integration, and VA facilities
* Psychological scars of war went unrecognized, leading to disappearance of traumatic neuroses from official psychiatric nomenclature
* Last scientific writing on combat trauma after WWII in 1947.

### TRAUMA REDISCOVERED

* **Trauma and Vietnam War**:
  - No books on war trauma in VA library (1960s)
  - Numerous studies, scholarly organizations, PTSD diagnosis (1970s)
  - Public interest in trauma growing

* **Misconceptions about Incest**:
  - Freedman and Kaplan's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry (1974)
    * Claimed incest rare, beneficial
    * Incorrect and misguided

* **Survivors Speak Out**:
  - Feminist movement and awareness of trauma
  - Consciousness-raising groups, survivor groups
  - Popular books on recovery from trauma (The Courage to Heal, Trauma and Recovery)

* **False Memory Syndrome Backlash**:
  - Articles denying existence of traumatic memory loss
  - Claimed no evidence for memory loss in traumatic events
  - Contradicts historical evidence (John Eric Erichsen, Frederic Myers, Charles Samuel Myers, W.H.R. Rivers)

* **Memory Loss in Trauma**:
  - Not controversial before 1980s and early 1990s
  - Observed in combat soldiers, Dunkirk evacuees, Vietnam veterans, survivors of domestic abuse

* **Pedophile Scandals and False Memories**:
  - Memory problems moved from science to politics and law
  - Church experts claimed memories unreliable or implanted by therapists
  - Over fifty adults with claims of priest abuse denied in about half the cases

### THE SCIENCE OF REPRESSED MEMORY

* Hundreds of scientific publications documenting repressed trauma memories over a century
* Memory loss reported in people experiencing natural disasters, accidents, war trauma, kidnapping, torture, concentration camps, and physical/sexual abuse
* Total memory loss most common in childhood sexual abuse (19%-38%)
* DSM-III recognized memory loss for traumatic events in dissociative amnesia since 1980
* PTSD diagnosis includes memory loss since its introduction

**Study by Dr. Linda Meyer Williams:**

* Began as a graduate student interviewing 206 girls (ages 10-12) admitted to hospital following sexual abuse
* Interviewed 136 women (now adults) 17 years later
* 38% did not recall documented abuse, while only 12% said they had never been abused
* 68% reported other incidents of childhood sexual abuse
* Women who were younger and knew the abuser were more likely to forget
* 16% of those who recalled abuse forgot it at some point but later remembered
* Recovered memories were approximately as accurate as those that had never been lost

**Neuroscience Research:**

* Memories change when retrieved, especially if told repeatedly
* Memories are less likely to be changed while inaccessible

**Controversy over Repressed Memories:**

* Some cognitive scientists denied existence or accuracy of repressed memories due to lack of laboratory documentation
* Studies on implanted memories and eyewitness testimony have little relevance to traumatic memory
* Trauma cannot be induced de novo in a lab setting, so studying original imprint of trauma is necessary

**Dr. Roger Pitman's Study:**

* Showed college students a violent movie (Faces of Death) but did not cause PTSD symptoms in normal volunteers
* To study traumatic memory, one must study the memories of people who have been traumatized

**Conclusion:**

* Controversy over repressed memories disappeared once courtroom testimony became less profitable for scientists
* Clinicians are left to deal with the complexities of traumatic memory.

### NORMAL VERSUS TRAUMATIC MEMORY

**Study Comparing Benign and Traumatic Memories**

* In 1994, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital studied memory recall of benign and traumatic experiences.
* Advertisements were placed in local newspapers, laundromats, and student union bulletin boards for volunteers.
* Participants recalled non-traumatic events with a beginning, middle, and end; no vivid sensory recollections.
* Traumatic memories were disorganized, with some clear details but missing sequence or vital information.
* Trauma participants could not recall details immediately after the event.
* Flashbacks were common, with increasing sensory details and feelings over time.
* **Gradual improvement**: ability to piece together details and tell a coherent story.
* Five participants abused as children had the most fragmented narratives.
* **Traumatic memories are dissociated**: not properly assembled into a story or autobiography.
* Language cannot substitute for action in resolving trauma.
* Contemporary exposure treatment (CBT) has disappointing results, with persistent PTSD symptoms.

### LISTENING TO SURVIVORS

### LISTENING TO SURVIVORS

- Trauma is difficult to confront due to natural reluctance for its unpredictability and overwhelming nature.
- **Lawrence Langer's work in the Fortunoff Video Archive at Yale University**:
  - Listening to Holocaust testimonies reveals an incomplete, unfinished tale.
  - Witnesses struggle to communicate their experiences to those who didn't live through it.
- **Survivors describe a dual existence**:
  - The 'self' in the trauma is not the same as the present self.
  - Deep memory and common memory are distinct.
- **Trauma affects language**:
  - Words have different meanings before and after traumatic experiences.
- **Essence of trauma**:
  - Overwhelming, unbelievable, and unbearable.
  - Demands suspension of normalcy for dealing with a dual reality.
- **Langer's conclusion**:
  - Damaged mosaics of the mind need a proper grave to rest in peace.
  - Life goes on in two temporal directions at once.

### NANCY’S STORY

* Nancy, a director of nursing, underwent laparoscopic tubal ligation but received insufficient anesthesia.
* She became aware during the surgery and remained paralyzed, unable to alert the team.
* After the surgery, she experienced trauma symptoms including flashbacks, anxiety, fear, and avoidance.
* Flashbacks included memories of conversations in the OR and feelings of burning and terror.
* Nancy's marriage suffered, and she felt isolated and alone.
* She struggled with existential reality of trauma and dual existence.
* Recovery began when she chose a Boston hospital for another surgery, requested preoperative meeting, and asked for my presence in the OR.
* Woke up feeling safe and began working with a psychodynamic psychiatrist and joining a Pilates class.
* Found psychological, social, and physical core strengthening through therapy and Pilates.

**Trauma Experience:**

* Awake during laparoscopic tubal ligation surgery due to insufficient anesthesia.
* Paralyzed and unable to alert team or move.
* Experienced memories and flashbacks of the surgery, including conversations in the OR.
* Felt burning sensations and terror during flashbacks.
* Avoided triggers such as scrub suits and elevators.
* Struggled with existential reality of trauma and dual existence.
* Marriage suffered due to trauma symptoms.

**Recovery:**

* Chose Boston hospital for another surgery, requested preoperative meeting, and asked for my presence in the OR.
* Found psychological safety through therapy with a psychodynamic psychiatrist.
* Found social support and physical core strengthening through Pilates class.
* Relegated memories to the distant past, allowing present and future to emerge.

* Need to confront past, but only after feeling safe

**Coping with Overwhelming Sensations and Emotions**

* Find ways to manage feelings of being overwhelmed
* Engines of post-traumatic reactions in emotional brain

**Role of Rational Brain**

* Understanding emotions and origins
* Cannot abolish emotions, sensations, or thoughts
* Helps explain why we feel a certain way

**Limitations of Understanding**

* Does not change how we feel
* Rational brain takes a backseat when frazzled

### LIMBIC SYSTEM THERAPY

- **Goal**: Restore balance between rational and emotional brains
- Trauma pushes individuals outside "window of tolerance"
  - **Hyperaroused**: reactive, disorganized, filters stop working
  - **Hypoaroused**: numb, sluggish thinking, difficulty moving
- Cannot learn from experience in hyperaroused or shut down states
- Recovery involves restoring executive functioning and self-confidence
- Necessary to access emotional brain for change through "limbic system therapy"
  - Repair faulty alarm systems
  - Restore emotional brain to quiet background presence

**Emotional Brain:**

- **Affects body functions**: eating, sleeping, connecting, protecting
- Accessed through self-awareness and interoception (looking inside)
- Most conscious brain focused on outside world, not self-management

**Self-Awareness:**

- Activates medial prefrontal cortex
- Allows feeling of inner experience
- Essential for changing emotions and managing self

### BEFRIENDING THE EMOTIONAL BRAIN. 
### 1. DEALING WITH HYPERAROUSAL

* Mainstream psychiatry focus on drugs for dealing with hyper- and hypoarousal
* **Inbuilt skills to regulate arousal system**: breathing, chanting, movement
* Vagus nerve connection between brain and organs allows direct training
* Yoga effective in reducing PTSD symptoms (chapter 16)
* Neurofeedback helpful for hyperaroused individuals (chapter 19)
* Parasympathetic nervous system effects through deep breathing
* Oxygen's role in nourishing the body and promoting engagement
* Western traditions neglect self-management, focusing on drugs and verbal therapies
* Non-Western healing traditions rely on mindfulness, movement, rhythms, and action
* **Examples**: yoga (India), tai chi and qigong (China), martial arts (Japan, Korea, Brazil)
* Few of these practices systematically studied for PTSD treatment.

### 2. NO MIND WITHOUT MINDFULNESS

**Mindfulness and Self-Awareness in Trauma Recovery**

* Core of recovery: self-awareness
* Importance of mindfulness: noticing sensations, shifting perspective, opening up new options
* Traumatized people avoid uncomfortable sensations due to fear
* Body awareness puts us in touch with inner world and transient nature of feelings
* Mindfulness calms down sympathetic nervous system, allowing for exploration of past experiences

**Barriers to Inner Experience**

* Fear of physical sensations
* Compulsive behaviors (eating, drinking, avoiding social activities) as coping mechanisms
* Emotional brain generates sensations that keep sufferer feeling scared and helpless

**Practicing Mindfulness**

* Focus on physical sensations and notice how they shift
* Label sensations to increase control
* Observe interplay between thoughts and physical sensations
* Mindfulness decreases reactivity to potential triggers (decreases amygdala activity)

**Benefits of Mindfulness**

* Positive effects on psychiatric, psychosomatic, and stress-related symptoms
* Improvements in immune response, blood pressure, cortisol levels
* Activates brain regions involved in emotional regulation and body awareness
* Broad effects on physical health

**Mindfulness as a Lens**

* Mindfulness transforms scattered and reactive energies of the mind into coherent source of energy for living, problem solving, healing.
* Positively impacts depression, chronic pain, immune response, blood pressure, cortisol levels, emotional regulation, body awareness, fear, reactivity to potential triggers.

### 3. RELATIONSHIPS

**Relationships and Trauma**

- Having a good support network is crucial in protecting against trauma.
- Safety and terror are incompatible, and trusted people provide comfort and reassurance.
- **Recovery from trauma requires physical and emotional safety, familiar faces, food, shelter, time to sleep, and communication with loved ones.**
- Trauma survivors benefit from relationships with families, friends, support groups, or professional therapists.
- **Relationships help provide safety, reduce shame, and bolster courage to face reality of trauma.**
- Humans are wired for attachment and connection; recovery involves reconnecting with others.
- Trauma within relationships is more challenging to treat due to the breach of trust.
- Child abuse, molestation, and domestic violence can knock out the primary protection against being traumatized.
- **Unresolved trauma can lead to dissociation, despair, addictions, chronic panic, and unhealthy relationships.**
- Shame plays a role in fearing rejection and abandonment.
- Unacknowledged trauma can negatively impact current feelings and behaviors.
- Trusted individuals are needed to help face inner emotions and process past experiences.

### CHOOSING A PROFESSIONAL THERAPIST

- Gender, race, and background irrelevant if not interfering with safety and understanding
- Engaging with animals can help some patients feel safer (e.g., horses, dogs)
- Therapeutic settings applying this principle effectively (jails, residential programs, veterans' rehabilitation)

**Trauma Therapist Training:**

- Mastering techniques for stabilizing, calming, and reconnecting patients
- Ideally, therapists have personal experience with therapy
- No one treatment of choice for trauma
- Open to exploring different options and learning from patient

**Selecting a Therapist:**

- Important that patient feels comfortable and safe
- **Collaborative process**: therapist curious about patient's unique needs

**Impact of Childhood Abuse:**

- Survivors may have difficulty feeling safe with humans
- Engaging with animals can help some patients feel safer

**Effective Therapeutic Settings:**

- Applying principle of engaging with animals effectively (jails, residential programs, veterans' rehabilitation)

### 4. COMMUNAL RHYTHMS AND SYNCHRONY

* **Communal rhythms and synchrony**:
  * From birth, relationships are based on physical synchrony (facial expressions, gestures, touch)
  * Trauma results in breakdown of attuned physical synchrony
  * Patients with PTSD exhibit frozen faces and collapsed bodies
  * Many therapists focus only on words and ignore physical communications

* **Healing power of community through music, rhythms, and movement**:
  * Witnessed transformation of rape survivors in South Africa through communal singing and dancing
  * Various activities like choral singing, aikido, tango dancing, and kickboxing have helped traumatized individuals
  * Sensorimotor therapy used to help mute girl Ying Mee after failed attempts with traditional methods
  * Sensory integration therapy involves engaging senses to promote connection and communication

* **Parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) and SMART**:
  * Interactive therapies that foster physical attunement between parents and children

* **Improvisation exercises**:
  * Help people connect through joy and exploration
  * Break the spell of misery when groups start giggling.

### 5. GETTING IN TOUCH

**Getting in Touch**

- Mainstream trauma treatment overlooks the importance of helping individuals safely experience sensations and emotions
- Humans naturally calm down through touch, hugging, and rocking
- **Touch is underutilized in therapeutic practices**
- Recovery impossible without feeling safe in one's skin

**Benefits of Bodywork**

- Establishing personal connection before session
- Careful assessment of client's comfort and safety
- Meeting resistance with equal energy to release tension
- Touch provides comfort, grounds people, and releases physical and emotional tensions
- Allows discovery of unaware tensions
- Releases feelings and deepens breathing
- Helps individuals understand their body boundaries and feel safe

**Bodywork Practitioner's Approach**

- Establishing personal connection before session
- Careful assessment of client's comfort and safety
- Meeting resistance with equal energy to release tension
- Firm, safe contact with slow, easy touch
- Touch can start at hand and forearm
- Meeting point of resistance with confidence and empathy

**Effects of Bodywork**

- Releases physical and emotional tensions
- Allows deeper breathing and expressive sounds
- Helps individuals live in a body that moves freely
- Provides sense of safety and understanding of body boundaries

### 6. TAKING ACTION

**Taking Action**
* Stress hormones are meant to help us respond to extraordinary conditions
* Utilizing stress hormones through action reduces risk of trauma
* Helplessness and immobilization prevent proper use of stress hormones
* Trauma imprints on body, causing persistent emergency response

**Somatic Therapies**

* Sensorimotor psychotherapy, somatic experiencing
* Explore physical sensations and discover trauma imprints on body
* Build internal resources for safe access to emotions
* Gradually expand window of tolerance through pendulation
* Bring incomplete trauma-related "action tendencies" to completion
* Restore a sense of agency and ability to defend oneself.

**Impact of Trauma**

* Stress hormones meant to give strength and endurance
* Helplessness and immobilization prevent proper use, leading to persistent emergency response
* Body needs to be restored to baseline state for proper functioning.

### INTEGRATING TRAUMATIC MEMORIES

**Integrating Traumatic Memories**

- Ordinary memories do not involve reliving sensory or emotional elements.
- Traumatic memories are experienced as fragments of sensations, images, and emotions.
- Brain structures necessary for engagement in the present must be online for trauma integration.

**Traditional Psychotherapy and Trauma**

- Focuses on constructing narratives to explain feelings.
- Telling the story does not guarantee resolution of traumatic memories.

**Brain Function and Trauma**

- Key brain areas go blank during traumatic memory recall.
- Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) keeps necessary brain structures online for trauma integration.
- Dissociation shuts down necessary brain functions, complicating recovery.

**Historical Treatment of Trauma**

- Hypnosis was widely used to treat trauma from late 1800s to after World War II.
- Fell out of favor in the 1990s but may make a comeback due to its potential for trauma integration.
- Induces a calm state, allowing observation of traumatic experiences without being overwhelmed.

### COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT)
- Most psychologists are trained in CBT
- **Developed to treat irrational fears through exposure techniques**: imaginal, in vivo, or virtual
- Patients gradually desensitized by repeated exposure without bad consequences
- Helps patients deal with avoidance tendencies

**CBT for PTSD:**

- Not as effective as for irrational fears
- One in three participants with PTSD show improvement after finishing studies
- Fewer symptoms but not complete recovery for most
- High dropout rates and adverse reactions
- Ineffective for dealing with guilt and complex emotions

**Exposure Techniques:**

- Prolonged exposure or "flooding"
  * Focus on traumatic material without distraction
  * Up to 100 minutes required for decreases in anxiety
  * Not effective for all PTSD symptoms

**Virtual Reality Therapy:**

- Limited benefit compared to real-world therapy
- Traumatized patients need help feeling alive in the present

**Challenges with CBT for PTSD:**

- Overwhelming trauma can prevent resolution
- Mental defeat and lack of motivation are common issues
- Brain changes from trauma affect focus on everyday life

**Real World Therapy:**

- Helps patients feel alive in the present
- Important for dealing with complex emotions and symptoms

**Study of Vietnam Veterans:**

- Repeatedly talking about experiences led to panic and increased symptoms for some veterans
- Some dropped out, others became more depressed, violent, and fearful
- Increased alcohol consumption led to further problems.

### DESENSITIZATION

**Desensitization vs. Integration**

- **Prevailing treatment for psychology students**: systematic desensitization
- **Goal of desensitization**: helping patients become less reactive to certain emotions and sensations
- **Alternative perspective**: integration of traumatic events into overall life arc

**Child's Example**

- Boy unfazed by father's yelling
- **Author's reaction**: heart racing, impulse to intervene
- **Question**: what price for child's indifference?

**Desensitization and Emotional Sensitivity**

- Desensitization leads to blunting of emotional sensitivity (Jean Decety)
- Medical students learn to stay analytical during treatment of severe burns
- Desensitization to pain can lead to overall emotional numbness

**Effectiveness of Exposure Treatment**

- **2010 report on veterans with PTSD**: fewer than one out of ten completed recommended treatment
- Exposure treatment rarely works for veterans (Pitman's research)
- Horrendous experiences must not overwhelm to be processed effectively

**Necessity of Other Approaches**

- Other approaches necessary for processing traumatic experiences
- Desensitization alone may not be sufficient.

### DRUGS TO SAFELY ACCESS TRAUMA?

**Drugs for Trauma Treatment:**

- In the 1960s, professor Jan Bastiaans in Netherlands used LSD for Holocaust survivor treatment with questionable results (few data)
- Research on mind-altering substances for trauma treatment neglected until 2000
- MDMA (ecstasy), a controlled substance since 1985, studied for trauma treatment due to hormonal effects and decreased fear/defensiveness
- MDMA increases oxytocin, vasopressin, cortisol, prolactin, self-awareness, compassion, clarity, confidence, creativity, and connectedness
- Enhances psychotherapy effectiveness by enabling patients to revisit traumatic memories without overwhelming arousal

**MDMA Studies:**

- **Initial pilot studies with positive results**: combat veterans, firefighters, police officers with PTSD
- **Study on unresponsive assault victims**: 83% of MDMA group vs. 25% placebo group considered cured, no adverse effects
- Long-term gains maintained after more than a year
- Difference lies in association and integration rather than desensitization

**Cautions:**

- Powerful agents with troubled history
- Careless administration and poor therapeutic boundaries can lead to misuse
- MDMA not another "magic cure"

### WHAT ABOUT MEDICATIONS?

**Medications for Traumatic Stress**

* People have used drugs to cope with traumatic stress throughout history
* Mainstream psychiatry spends over $4.5 billion on psychotropic drugs for military personnel
* 20% of active-duty troops surveyed were taking some form of psychotropic drug
* Drugs cannot cure trauma, only dampen symptoms
* SSRIs (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.) can make feelings less intense and help with therapy engagement
* Autonomic nervous system medications (propranolol, clonidine) reduce hyperarousal and reactivity
* Benzodiazepines (Klonopin, Valium, Xanax) calm patients but have high addiction potential and interfere with trauma processing
* Anticonvulsants and mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate) have mildly positive effects
* Second-generation antipsychotics (Risperdal, Seroquel) can be helpful in extreme cases but interfere with emotional experience and cause side effects
* No studies on the effects of psychotropic medications on developing brains
* Combat veterans and civilians respond differently to medications
* VA and DoD spend billions on medications for soldiers and veterans without providing other forms of therapy

**SSRIs**

* Most thoroughly studied psychotropic agents for PTSD
* Can make feelings less intense and improve engagement in therapy
* Patients may feel calmer or blunted
* Prozac, Zoloft, Effexor, Paxil

**Autonomic Nervous System Medications**

* Decrease hyperarousal and reactivity to stress
* Block physical effects of adrenaline
* Reduce nightmares, insomnia, and trauma triggers
* Propranolol, clonidine

**Benzodiazepines**

* Calm patients and keep them from worrying
* Weaken inhibitions against hurtful behavior
* High addiction potential
* Interfere with trauma processing
* Patients may experience withdrawal reactions when stopping use

**Anticonvulsants and Mood Stabilizers**

* Mildly positive effects on hyperarousal and panic
* Lithium, valproate

**Second-Generation Antipsychotics**

* Calm down combat veterans and women with PTSD related to childhood abuse
* Block dopamine system, interfering with emotional experience and pleasure
* Risperdal, Abilify, Seroquel
* Significant side effects including weight gain, diabetes, inertia, and interference with learning and developing friendships

**Differences between Combat Veterans and Civilians**

* Traumatized civilians tend to respond better to medications than combat veterans
* Discrepancies found in studies since Prozac study in chapter 2
* VA and DoD prescribe enormous quantities of medications to soldiers and veterans without providing other forms of therapy
* No studies on the effects of psychotropic medications on developing brains
* Risperdal and Seroquel spent $1.5 billion by VA, $90 million by Defense between 2001-2011 (ineffective for PTSD)
* Benzodiazepines spent $72.1 million by VA, $44.1 million by Defense between 2001-2012 (generally avoided for civilians with PTSD due to addiction potential and lack of effectiveness)

### THE ROAD OF RECOVERY IS THE ROAD OF LIFE

**The Road of Recovery is the Road of Life**

- Introduced patient Bill, met at VA in the 1980s
- Served as medic in Vietnam (1967–71)

- Continues to cope with physical limitations
- Teaches yoga to over 1,300 veterans
- Flashbacks and weakness in limbs are part of life's ongoing story.

## CHAPTER 14 
### LANGUAGE: MIRACLE AND TYRANNY

**September 2001, post-9/11**:
- Several organizations organized expert panels to recommend best treatments for traumatized people.
- Opportunity to compare different approaches.

**Recommendations**:
- Psychoanalytically oriented therapy (Freudian psychoanalysis) due to local practitioners.
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) due to academic researchers.

**Surprising Results**:
- Few survivors showed up for "traditional" therapies.

**Dr. Spencer Eth's Survey, 2002**:
- Survivors credited acupuncture, massage, yoga, and EMDR as most helpful.
- Rescue workers preferred massages.

**Disparity between Survivors' Experience and Experts' Recommendations**:
- **Question**: What is the value of talking about trauma?
- Unknown how many survivors sought traditional therapies later.

### THE UNSPEAKABLE TRUTH

* **The belief in talk as a solution for trauma**

  * Dates back to Freud and Breuer's work in 1893
  * Trauma "disappears" when memory is brought to light and affect is expressed

* **Limitations of putting traumatic events into words**

  * Impossible for most people, including those without PTSD
  * Initial reactions to September 11 were images, not stories
  * Trauma creates "pitch-sharp" emotions that mind and memory can't fully register

* **The importance of narrative in processing trauma**

  * Narrative helps share experiences with others
  * Giuliani and media helped create a shared narrative after September 11

* **The path to revealing the whole story**

  * Paved with carefully assembled words, piece by piece
  * Helps make traumatic experiences less overwhelming and more manageable.

### BREAKING THE SILENCE


* **Silence and Trauma:** Silence about trauma can lead to isolation and prevent healing. Naming and acknowledging traumatic experiences are crucial for starting the healing process.
* **Power of Naming:** Giving a name to our experiences allows us to control them, recognize emotions, and begin the healing process. It also changes our physiology and creates an "aha moment."
* **Impact of Silence:** Hiding from ourselves traumatic experiences can lead to irrational behaviors, stress hormones, and health problems. Suppressing information leaves us at war with ourselves and vulnerable to triggers.
* **Importance of Speaking Out:** Talking about traumatic experiences with someone who listens and understands can help us feel heard and understood, leading to improved mental and physical health.
* **Impact of Trauma on Identity:** Trauma can lead to a sense of being dead inside, feeling disconnected from ourselves, and questioning our identity. Allowing ourselves to know what we know is essential for healing.
* **Case Study: Vietnam Veterans** - Karl Marlantes' experience of returning from war with a split personality and the need to tell the truth about his experiences to begin the healing process.
* **Healing through Sharing:** Forming groups where soldiers can share their experiences can help reestablish a sense of being part of the human race and open hearts to loved ones.

### THE MIRACLE OF SELF-DISCOVERY

**Helen Keller's Journey into Language**

* At 19 months old, Helen lost her sight and hearing due to a viral infection.
* Five years later, Anne Sullivan, a partially blind teacher, was invited to be Helen's tutor.
* Anne taught Helen the manual alphabet but faced challenges connecting with her wild and isolated child.

**Breakthrough: The Power of Words**

* The turning point came when Anne spelled the word "water" into Helen's hand while she was holding it under a water pump.
* This experience awakened Helen's soul and enabled her to understand the names of things.
* Learning language allowed Helen to create an inner representation of reality and discover herself.

**The Impact of Language on Selfhood**

* Six months after this breakthrough, Helen started using the first-person "I."
* Before learning language, Helen felt bewildered and self-centered, calling herself "Phantom."
* Acquiring language allowed Helen to join a community and communicate with others.

**The Therapeutic Power of Language**

* The therapeutic relationship is characterized by finding words where they were absent before.
* Sharing deep pain and feelings with another human being is a profound experience.
* Communicating fully is the opposite of being traumatized.

### KNOWING YOURSELF OR TELLING YOUR STORY? OUR DUAL AWARENESS SYSTEM

* **Limitation of Language in Talk Therapy:**
  - Difficulty in feeling feelings deeply while reporting them to someone else
  - Choice between reliving old scenes and telling a logical, coherent story
  - Easy to lose touch with self and focus on analyst's opinion

**Two Distinct Forms of Self-Awareness:**
- **Autobiographical Self:**
  - Creates connections among experiences
  - Assembles them into a coherent story
  - Rooted in language
  - Changes with telling and perspective
- **Moment-to-moment Self-Awareness:**
  - Based on physical sensations
  - Registers the self in the present moment
  - Primarily localized in medial prefrontal cortex
  - Can change emotional brain

**Interplay of Two Systems:**
- Soldiers radiated pride and belonging while telling horrible tales
- Patients told stories of happy families with anxious bodies
- Public story may not contain the whole truth
- Second system registers deep, inner experience

**Case Study:**
- Young woman with temporal lobe epilepsy
- Standard questions did not explain her suicide attempt
- Asked about how it felt for the five-year-old girl to be diagnosed and left alone
- Fierce defense of coping mechanism
- Allowed abandoned, frightened girl to tell her story
- Public story and inner experience met

### THE BODY IS THE BRIDGE

**Importance of Trauma Stories:**
- Lessen isolation
- Provide explanations
- Allow diagnoses
- Offer targets for blame

**Obscuring the Real Issue:**
- Trauma radically changes people
- Difficult to describe feeling of no longer being oneself
- Language evolved primarily for sharing "things out there"
- Most private experiences hard to describe

**Getting Past Slippery Words:**
- Engage self-observing, body-based self system
- Speaks through sensations, tone of voice, and body tensions
- Foundation of emotional awareness

**Exploring Inner Feelings:**
- Patient's description of father deserting the family
- **Stop and ask for self-check**: What happens inside?
- Activate gut feelings and listen to heartbreak
- Follow interoceptive pathways to innermost recesses
- Things begin to change.

### WRITING TO YOURSELF

- Effective way to access inner world of feelings
- Can make you feel better even if not sent
- Free from judgment as it's for yourself
- Helps discover surprising truths
- Allows free flow of thoughts without worrying about reception
- Can be used in trance state, with pen or keyboard acting as an outlet
- Can lead to memories and associations unique to you
- Used in therapy sessions as a tool for self-exploration

**Writing Techniques:**

- **Free writing**: write whatever comes to mind without stopping, rereading or crossing out
- Use any object as a trigger for stream of associations
- Writing about traumas can help process hidden parts of self

**Pennebaker's Studies:**

- **Divided students into three groups**: writing about current life, trauma details, and facts & feelings about trauma
- Students took study seriously, revealing deep secrets and crying during writing sessions
- Those who wrote about traumas had fewer doctor visits and improved health
- Writing about emotions and feelings led to increased self-understanding

**Physiological Changes:**

- **Writing about traumas led to significant physiological changes**: increased heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension, and hand temperature
- Long-term drop in blood pressure and improved immune function

**Switching:**

- Patients who write about intimate or difficult issues often show distinct emotional and physiological states (switching)
- Changes can manifest as different vocal patterns, facial expressions, body movements, and handwriting
- Failure to appreciate these different states can lead to mute patients who transmit help in other ways (suicide attempts, depression, rage attacks)

### ART, MUSIC, AND DANCE

* Art, music, and dance therapies used for treating traumatized individuals (abused children, soldiers, victims of incest, refugees, torture survivors)
* Thousands of practitioners, but little research on how they work or specific aspects of trauma addressed
* Expressive therapies may help circumvent speechlessness caused by terror
* Study by Pennebaker and Krantz compared expressive body movements with writing
	+ Group 1: Expressive movement + writing for ten minutes/day for three days
	+ Group 2: Expressive movement only
	+ Group 3: Routine exercise program
	+ All groups reported feeling happier and healthier after three months
	+ Only group 1 (expressive movement + writing) showed objective evidence of improved physical health and better grade-point average
* **Conclusion**: Expression of trauma is not enough, translating experiences into language is essential for healing
* Writing studies on PTSD symptoms have been disappointing
* Pennebaker cautions that most writing studies were done in group settings where participants were expected to share stories
* Objective of writing is to write for yourself, to let yourself know what you've been avoiding.

### THE LIMITS OF LANGUAGE

Paul Fussell's "The Great War in Modern Memory" discusses the challenge of describing traumatic experiences using available language

**Language and Trauma:**
- Trauma overwhelms speakers and listeners
- English language rich in terms to describe trauma but societal norms limit use
- Soldiers fall silent due to lack of interest from listeners

**Challenges of Expressing Trauma:**
- Families, friends, and organizations may reject those who air dirty laundry
- Survivor groups and professional therapists provide safe spaces for expressing pain
- Therapists need emotional preparation to listen to traumatic stories

**Speechless or Confused Trauma Victims:**
- Some victims become speechless or confused when testifying about their experiences
- Their testimony can be dismissed as chaotic and unreliable
- Legal cases may be dismissed due to incoherent accounts of trauma reasons for fleeing

**Therapy Techniques:**
- Establishing "islands of safety" within the body
- Focusing on hands, breath, lifting arms, tapping acupressure points, and feeling body weight
- Pendulating between states of exploration and safety is essential for trauma resolution.

### DEALING WITH REALITY

- People with PTSD have difficulties with focused attention and learning new information (McFarlane's study)
  - Normal subjects averaged fifteen words in one minute, PTSD subjects averaged three or four
  - PTSD patients react hesitantly to ordinary words under threat
- Daily life challenges for people with PTSD
  - Expend more energy on living than non-traumatized individuals
  - Making real contributions in various fields and raising children
- Illusion of easily correcting "dysfunctional thinking" in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
  - **Top-down approach to change**: challenging or reframing negative cognitions
  - **Irrational thoughts in traumatized people**: blame, fear of being a man, should have known better
- Treat irrational thoughts as cognitive flashbacks
  - Don't argue with them; they are residues of traumatic incidents
- A better way to treat irrational thoughts is with EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)

### BECOMING SOME BODY

* Trauma causes long-term effects on the brain, acting like a foreign object that continues to affect the individual (Freud's notion of psychical trauma)
* Modern neuroscience supports Freud's idea that conscious thoughts are rationalizations for unconscious processes
* Trauma affects brain areas responsible for managing and interpreting experiences
* A healthy sense of self depends on proper functioning of these areas
* Trauma often causes abnormal activation of the insula, leading to alexithymia (inability to sense and communicate bodily sensations) and dissociation
* Alexithymia results in feeling disconnected from one's body or like no body at all
* Language is essential for organizing memories into a coherent whole, requiring proper connections between conscious brain and body systems
* Overcoming trauma involves getting back in touch with the body and repairing damaged structures to regain a sense of self.

## CHAPTER 15 
### LETTING GO OF THE PAST: EMDR

* David, a contractor in his middle age, sought therapy due to violent rage attacks
* Triggered by an assault at age 23, when he was a lifeguard and lost his eye in a beer bottle attack
* Suffered from nightmares, flashbacks, criticized son mercilessly, unable to show affection towards wife
* Felt permission to abuse others due to past trauma, but hated the person he had become
* Chronically tense, fear of losing control made love and friendship impossible

**First Session:**

* Introduced Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)
* Asked David to recall details of assault, bring back images, sounds, thoughts
* Used finger movements to facilitate processing
* Cascades of rage and terror surfaced, followed by deep breaths and focusing on new memories

**Second Session:**

* Dealt with the aftermath of trauma: use of drugs and alcohol to cope with rage
* More memories arose: wanting to hurt assailants, barroom brawls
* Encouraged David to notice and stay with each memory
* Realization of turning away from revenge was liberating

**Third Session:**

* Recognized treating son the same way he felt towards attackers
* Asked for family therapy session to ask for forgiveness

**Fifth and Final Session:**

* Reported improved sleep, inner peace, closer relationship with wife, more laughter, pleasure in gardening and woodworking

**EMDR Process:**

* Go back to details of traumatic event
* Bring back images, sounds, thoughts
* Follow therapist's finger movements
* Notice and stay with new memories as they emerge
* Take deep breaths and focus on current memory
* Encouragement from therapist during processing
* Repeat process until intensity of trauma lessens.

### LEARNING ABOUT EMDR

**Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing**
- Introduced to EMDR through Maggie, a sexually abused woman in therapy group
- Previously had a troubled past with multiple issues: drug use, violent relationships, instability
- Revealed her father raped her twice as a child, believed it was her fault
- Attended EMDR training and shared remarkable experience

**EMDR Session Experience**
- Vividly remembered father's rape from inside child's body
- Felt physically small and smelled father's alcohol breath
- Observed incident from the perspective of her adult self
- Burst into tears, realized it wasn't her fault, trauma was over

**Impact of EMDR on Maggie**

- Less angry but kept sardonic sense of humor
- Involved with a different kind of man
- Left group, believing she had resolved her trauma

**Personal Experience and Curiosity**

- Astounded by Maggie's experience
- Sought a way to help people revisit traumatic past without being retraumatized
- Decided to get trained in EMDR after witnessing its effectiveness.

### EMDR: FIRST EXPOSURES

**EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)**

- Originated from psychologist Francine Shapiro's observation of the relief from distress after rapid eye movements in 1987
- Developed into a standardized procedure through years of experimentation and research

**Personal Experience with EMDR**

- Attended first training session in need of trauma processing due to professional setbacks
- Experienced vivid, floating memories during session without discussing specific traumatic event
- Felt resigned and able to move on after session

**Observing EMDR with Another Client**

- Client unwilling to discuss traumatic experiences
- Appeared distressed during session but reported resolution afterwards
- Gerry Puk, trainer, advised Bessel to respect client's privacy during sessions

**Key Insights from EMDR**

- Loosens up something in the mind/brain for rapid access to past memories and images
- May allow healing without verbal discussion of traumatic experiences
- Effective even with a non-trusting relationship between patient and therapist
- Does not require patients to speak about intolerable experiences or explain feelings to therapist
- Can be effective with language barriers using a translator for process explanation

### STUDYING EMDR

**EMDR and The Trauma Clinic**

- Manager at Massachusetts Department of Mental Health asked team to organize community trauma response team for Boston area
- Discovered power of EMDR in treating previously unresponsive PTSD patients
- Weekly improvements observed through videotapes and standard PTSD rating scale
- Neuroimaging specialist scanned 12 patients before and after treatment
- Eight of twelve showed significant decrease in PTSD scores and brain activity changes

**Secured funding from NIMH for comparison study with Prozac or placebo**
- Placebo group had greatest improvement (42%)
- Prozac group slightly better than placebo but not statistically significant
- **EMDR group showed substantial improvement**: 1 in 4 completely cured after eight sessions, 60% completely cured eight months later
- **Adults with childhood trauma responded differently**: 73% adult-onset group cured eight months later vs. 25% child abuse group
- Child abuse group had small but consistent responses to Prozac
- Study demonstrated EMDR's effectiveness compared to medication for PTSD treatment

**Additional Findings**

- Chronic childhood abuse causes different mental and biological adaptations than discrete adult traumas
- EMDR not necessarily resolves effects of betrayal and abandonment in childhood trauma
- Eight weeks of therapy rarely sufficient to resolve long-standing trauma
- First solid scientific study using EMDR in combat veterans with PTSD (EMDR more effective than biofeedback-assisted relaxation therapy)
- EMDR now sanctioned by Department of Veterans Affairs for PTSD treatment.

### IS EMDR A FORM OF EXPOSURE THERAPY?

* EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is related to exposure therapy, but it integrates traumatic material instead of just desensitizing it

**Memory Processing:**
  * Memories undergo integration and reinterpretation after being laid down
  * In PTSD, this process fails and memories remain raw and undigested
  * Few psychologists are taught about memory processing in their training

* **Exposure Therapy**:
  * Patients relive traumatic experiences to reduce reactions
  * Initial response includes increased heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones
  * Prolonged exposure can lead to less reactivity and lower PTSD ratings
  * Does not integrate memories into overall context of a person's life

* **EMDR and Other Therapies**:
  * Focus on regulating intense memories and restoring agency, engagement, and commitment
  * Treatments include internal family systems, yoga, neurofeedback, psychomotor therapy, and theater.

### PROCESSING TRAUMA WITH EMDR
* Kathy was a 21-year-old student with a history of severe childhood abuse
* Had been in psychotherapy for three years without progress
* Able to focus on studies but struggled with relationships
* Recovered from trauma after eight EMDR sessions

**EMDR Session Details**

* Kathy sat facing therapist at a 45-degree angle
* Therapist asked her to recall a painful memory and rate its intensity
* Asked Kathy to follow therapist's moving finger with her eyes
* After each eye movement sequence, Kathy reported associations

**Associations during First Eye Movement Sequence**

* Recalled physical scars from abuse
* Described instances of being raped and doused in gasoline
* Looked stunned but surprisingly calm

**Associations during First Eye Movement Sequence**

* Recalled physical scars from abuse
* Described instances of rape and dousing in gasoline
* Looked stunned but surprisingly calm

**Subsequent Sequences**

* Saw herself as a karate fighter standing up to her abusers
* Realized the brutalization of the little girl within her
* Imagined herself holding her "little me" and feeling safe
* Had images of bulldozing down old house and starting anew
* Felt fear about being open with Jeffrey, a classmate
* Experienced intrusive memories of smells and father's presence
* Felt her mother apologizing for not protecting her
* Imagined her grandmother holding her and expressing regret for marrying abuser

**Outcome**

* Kathy integrated traumatic memories through EMDR, creating new associations and feelings
* Arrived at a sense of completion and control over her past experiences
* Minimal input from therapist required
* New images, emotions, and thoughts emerged, allowing for personal growth.

**Remarkable Feature of EMDR**

* Activates unsought and seemingly unrelated sensations, emotions, images, and thoughts in conjunction with the original memory
* May be how we integrate ordinary experiences as well.

### EXPLORING THE SLEEP CONNECTION

* **EMDR at Sleep Laboratory:** Speaker shares success story of PTSD patient treated with EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)
* **Connection to Dreams:** Researcher Robert Stickgold becomes interested in EMDR after witnessing its effectiveness
* **Role of Dreams in Mood Regulation:** Article suggests EMDR is related to REM sleep, where dreams occur
* **Importance of REM Sleep:** Increased REM sleep reduces depression; PTSD associated with disturbed sleep and disrupted REM sleep
* **Memory Processing during Sleep:** Deep sleep and REM sleep play roles in memory change; sleeping brain integrates unclear information
* **Dreams as Memory Recombination:** Dreams update subterranean realities, activate distant associations, and forge new relationships between memories
* **Creativity and Healing:** Ability to recombine experiences is essential to creativity and healing; PTSD patients are trapped in frozen associations
* **Link between EMDR and Sleep-Dependent Processes:** Stickgold suggests EMDR may take advantage of sleep-dependent processes for effective memory processing and trauma resolution
* **Study on Eye Movements during Trauma Recall:** Ruth Lanius and speaker studying brain reactions to saccadic eye movements in fMRI scanner while recalling traumatic events and ordinary experiences.

### ASSOCIATION AND INTEGRATION

**EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) vs Conventional Exposure Treatment:**

- EMDR spends little time revisiting original trauma
- Focuses on stimulating associative process
- Drugs like Prozac can blunt trauma images and sensations but not integrate them as past events
- EMDR patients no longer experience distinct imprints of trauma, considering it a story of the past
- How EMDR works is unclear, same goes for Prozac

**Clinical Practice and Experimentation:**

- **Clinicians' primary obligation**: help patients get better
- History of experimentation in clinical practice
- Some treatments fail, some succeed, some change therapy practice (EMDR, DBT, IFS)
- Research support for new treatments takes decades and is often hampered

**History of Penicillin:**

- Discovered antibiotic properties by Alexander Fleming in 1928
- Mechanisms elucidated in 1965 (almost 40 years later)

## CHAPTER 16 
### LEARNING TO INHABIT YOUR BODY: YOGA

- **Annie's Story**

* Annie, a special-needs teacher, appeared terrified and unable to engage during first session
* Fear prevented her from thinking or providing basic information
* Couldn't demand too much or she would shut down and leave
* Used qigong technique (breathing exercises) to help calm her down
* Gradually, Annie began to relax and show signs of improvement

**Background Information on Annie**

* Abused as a child by both parents
* Skilled and caring in her work with special-needs children
* Closed off about relationships with adults
* Married but rarely mentioned husband
* Coping mechanisms included self-harm and disappearing mentally during disagreements or confrontations
* Previous therapy and medication attempts unsuccessful
* Multiple psychiatric hospitalizations

**Early Therapy Sessions Focus**

**First Session with Annie**

* Slumped in chair, shaking legs, fixed gaze on floor
* Invited her into office but made no demands
* Encouraged deeper breathing using qigong technique
* Spent 30 minutes calming her physiological response
* Asked if she'd return for another session

**Annie's Background**

* Dreadful childhood abuse by both parents
* Skilled and caring teacher of special-needs children
* Closed off about relationships with adults
* Coped with disagreements and confrontations by disappearing mentally
* Self-destructive behaviors: cutting herself
* Previous therapy, medications, and hospitalizations had little effect

**Early Therapy Sessions**

* Focused on calming physiological chaos within
* Used various techniques to help Annie stay within her window of tolerance
* Breathing exercises with a focus on out breath
* Taught acupressure points tapping (Emotional Freedom Technique)

1. *EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique):* A practice that has been shown to help patients manage symptoms of PTSD.

### THE LEGACY OF INESCAPABLE SHOCK

* **Broken Alarm Systems:** Malfunctioning amygdala can cause misinterpretation of situations as life-threatening

**Annie's Case:**
  * Smoke detector (amygdala) rewired to perceive certain situations as dangerous
  * Simultaneously experienced agitation and mental shutdown
  * Past experiences led to fear response towards loved ones

* **Manifests in Various Ways:**
  * Compartmentalization of experiences in childhood
  * Love and dread held in separate states of consciousness

* **Impact on Annie:**
  * Blamed herself for abuse
  * Belief rooted in emotional, survival brain
  * Could not change belief without feeling safe in her body

* **Childhood Compartmentalization:**
  * Children can separate experiences easily
  * Annie's love and dread towards father were distinct

* **Impact of Abuse:**
  * Belief that she led father on and brought molestation upon herself
  * Rational mind knew it was nonsense but belief came from emotional brain
  * Could not change until she felt safe enough to revisit the experience.

### THE NUMBING WITHIN

**The Numbing Within**

- Trauma survivors store memories as muscle tension or feelings of disintegration in affected body areas
- Survivors may engage in self-numbing behaviors to cope with unwanted sensory experiences.
- **Self-numbing strategies**: 
  - obesity
  - anorexia
  - addiction to exercise or work
  - drugs
  - alcohol
  - cutting
  - sensation seeking
  - high-risk activities
- Numbing can lead to chronic pain, spasms, back pain, migraines, fibromyalgia, etc.
- People may visit multiple specialists, undergo extensive tests, and be prescribed medications for symptoms without addressing underlying trauma.
- First two years of therapy focused on helping survivors tolerate physical sensations
- Helped Annie learn to observe unbidden images and feelings as residues of past trauma without judgment
- Challenging to help patients regulate arousal and control physiology

**New Approaches: Yoga for Trauma Survivors**

- Stumbled upon yoga as a new way to help patients regulate their arousal and control their own physiology.

### FINDING OUR WAY TO YOGA: BOTTOM-UP REGULATION

**Understanding the Importance of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and its Connection to Yoga**

**Background:**
- Discovery of HRV as a measure of autonomic nervous system (ANS) balance in 1998
- ANS regulates arousal, with sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) branches
- Good HRV indicates optimal state of engagement with environment and self

**Importance of HRV:**
- Measures basic well-being and control over response to stressors
- Affects thinking, feeling, and body's response to stress
- Low HRV linked to physical illnesses (heart disease, cancer) and mental problems (depression, PTSD)

**Findings on HRV in PTSD:**
- Individuals with PTSD have unusually low HRV
- SNS and PNS are out of sync
- Explains vulnerability to overrespond to stressors

**Questions and Discoveries:**
- Is it possible to improve HRV?
- Personal incentive for exploration due to own poor HRV
- **Initial research**: marathon running increases HRV, but not feasible for everyone
- Internet search revealed conflicting claims about yoga's effect on HRV
- Scientific evidence lacking in 1998

**Later Discoveries:**
- Changing breathing patterns can improve problems with anger, depression, and anxiety
- Yoga positively affects medical conditions (high blood pressure, asthma, low-back pain)
- No psychiatric journal had published a study on yoga for PTSD until 2014

**Meeting David Emerson:**
- Yoga teacher with experience working with veterans and rape crisis center clients
- Developed modified form of hatha yoga to deal with PTSD
- Collaboration led to active yoga program and first NIH grant for studying the effects of yoga on PTSD

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Using handheld devices or apps to train HRV through breathing exercises
- Encouraging patients to practice at home if unable to attend yoga classes or other practices (qigong, martial arts)

### EXPLORING YOGA

- Decision to study yoga led to exploration of trauma's impact on the body
- First experimental classes held with donated studio space and volunteer instructors
- Selected 37 women with severe trauma histories for study, half in yoga group, other half in DBT group
- Measured Heart Rate Variability (HRV) to assess effects of yoga and DBT on psychological functioning
- **Yoga significantly improved arousal problems in PTSD and body relationship, DBT had no effect on arousal or symptoms**
- Interest shifted from HRV to helping traumatized people inhabit their bodies
- Successful implementation of yoga programs for veterans with PTSD, despite lack of formal research data

**Components of Yoga:**

- Combination of breath practices (pranayama), stretches or postures (asanas), and meditation
- Variations in intensity and focus within core components
- Simple approach in classes, focusing on breath awareness and body observation
- Gradual introduction to classic postures, emphasis on tension-relaxation rhythm
- Encouragement of mindfulness through observing bodily sensations

**Challenges with Trauma Recovery:**

- Difficulty achieving total relaxation and safe surrender in bodies
- Muscles remain prepared for fight or flight response during shavasana (final relaxation pose)

### LEARNING SELF-REGULATION

**Establishing a Therapeutic Yoga Program at the Trauma Center**

* Success of pilot studies led to program establishment
* Opportunity for Annie to develop caring relationship with body
* Difficulties and progress in yoga practice

**First Class Experience**

* Terrifying experience due to alarm system response
* Fear of being touched
* Realization of potential healing benefits

**Second Class and Beyond**

* Writing about experiences instead of talking
* Overcoming fear and attending classes regularly
* Discovering connection between mind and body
* Noticing physical tension and pain
* Reading "Yoga and the Quest for the True Self"
* Reflecting on disconnection from body and past denial
* Learning to listen to body's story

**Challenges in Yoga Practice**

* Difficulty with vulnerable poses (e.g., Happy Baby)
* Intense panic and vulnerability
* Importance of learning to comfortably assume challenging poses for intimacy and healing.

### GETTING TO KNOW ME: CULTIVATING INTEROCEPTION

**Interoception:**
- Anchors our sense of self
- Essential for navigating life
- Numbing or compensatory sensation seeking can lead to loss of body awareness

**Alexithymia:**
- Inability to identify inner feelings
- Leads to multiple vague physical complaints and difficulty responding to situations

**Benefits of Yoga:**
- Re-establishes relationship with interior world
- Cultivates sensory awareness
- Helps with emotional regulation
- Strengthens capacity to deal with discomfort
- Approaches body with curiosity instead of fear

**Effects of Trauma:**
- Makes individuals feel stuck in a helpless state
- Yoga helps individuals understand that experience is transitory

**Challenges of Practicing Yoga with Trauma:**
- Intense physical sensations can unleash past traumas
- Important to go slow and be patient.

### YOGA AND THE NEUROSCIENCE OF SELF-AWARENESS

* **Yoga and meditation have positive effects on brain areas critical for self-regulation** (insula, medial prefrontal cortex) according to research by Sara Lazar and Britta Hölzel at Harvard.
* Intensive meditation shown to increase activation of self-system in the brain.
* Study with six women with trauma history found increased activation after 20 weeks of yoga practice.
* **Participants reported**:
  * Recognizing emotions more powerfully.
  * Expressing feelings more effectively.
  * Seeing choices and deciding on life paths.
  * Feeling safe in their bodies during yoga practice.
* Research needs further exploration, but suggests that noticing and befriending bodily sensations can lead to healing from trauma.

### LEARNING TO COMMUNICATE

**Communicating Past Trauma**

**People who feel safe in their bodies can express repressed memories into language.**

- Annie practiced yoga three times a week for about a year.
- Noticed ability to talk freely about past experiences.
- Panic reaction to words that triggered traumatic memories.
- Wrote to therapist about being able to say the triggering words out loud.
- Attended morning yoga class and noticed the present moment through breathing exercises.
- Experienced panic in certain poses but was able to use them as information instead of being overwhelmed.

**Impact of Yoga on Annie's Life**

- Annie learned to manage her feelings instead of being hijacked by them.
- Increased self-awareness led to improved relationships, including becoming intimate with her husband.
- Regular yoga practice helped Annie feel more present in the moment and tolerant of physical touch.

## CHAPTER 17 
### PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER: SELF-LEADERSHIP

- Early in author's career, met Mary with history of abuse
- Three months into therapy, Mary appeared as "Jane"
- Dressed provocatively, warned therapist not to believe Mary's lies
- **Met different identities**: Jane, hurt little girl, angry male adolescent
- First encounter with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)
- Extreme end of mental life spectrum, but common for traumatized people
- Internal splitting and emergence of distinct identities
- **Important component of healing**: exploring and befriending those parts.

**Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)**

- Extreme form of mental life, but internal splitting common to all
- Survival mechanism for traumatized people
- Characterized by warring impulses or parts
- Exploring and befriending those parts is crucial for healing.

### DESPERATE TIMES REQUIRE DESPERATE MEASURES

* **Trauma leads to self-protection strategies**: humiliation, revenge, becoming powerful, etc.
  * Many psychiatric problems started as adaptations to trauma.
  * Trauma survivors are resilient but may pay a high price for coping.
* **Self-Protective Behaviors:** 
  * repressing feelings
  * plotting revenge 
  * becoming powerful 
  * denying reality 
  * suppressing emotions 
  * numbing sensations
* **Childhood Abuse:** children may hate themselves to protect relationship with caregivers, leading to self-loathing and denial in adulthood.
* **Short-term Adaptation, Long-term Consequences:** pushing away intense feelings can help in the short run but leads to isolation and unawareness of triggered parts later.
* **Parts of Self:** traumatized parts may trigger extreme beliefs and behaviors, requiring therapy to help them give up these beliefs.
* **Challenges of Recovery:** revisiting past memories and reconfiguring brain/mind system that was constructed to cope with trauma.

### THE MIND IS A MOSAIC
**Internal Leadership Skills:**

- Our ability to get along with ourselves depends on how well we listen to our different parts and take care of them
- Parts often come across as absolutes but represent only one aspect of our complex inner world

**Psychological Theories:**

- **William James:** consciousness can be split into parts that coexist but ignore each other
- **Carl Jung:** psyche is a self-regulating system with opposing components and the need for reconciliation
- **Michael Gazzaniga:** mind is composed of semiautonomous functioning modules or "selves"
- **Marvin Minsky:** there exists a society of different minds within our brains

**Therapeutic Approaches:**

- **Structural Dissociation Model:** developed by Onno van der Hart, Ellert Nijenhuis, and Kathy Steel for treating complex trauma
- **Internal Family Systems Therapy (IFS):** developed by Richard Schwartz to help individuals understand and work with their inner parts or "subpersonalities

**Parts and Trauma:**

- Trauma can result in polarized parts that go to war with one another, each carrying the burden of the trauma
- Extreme parts include self-loathing, grandiosity, loving care, hatred, numbing, rage, and aggression
- These parts are not just passing emotional states or thought patterns but distinct mental systems with their own history, abilities, needs, and worldview
- Trauma injects parts with beliefs and emotions that hijack them out of their naturally valuable state, leading to exiles (parts that hold pain, terror, betrayal) and protectors (parts that protect the self from the exiles)

**Understanding and Working with Parts:**

- IFS offers a framework for understanding and talking about parts in a nonpathologizing way
- Recognizing each part's function in the overall system makes it feel less threatening or overwhelming
- Collaborating with the internal system rather than teaching, confronting, or filling holes is essential for healing from trauma.

### SELF-LEADERSHIP

**Self-Leadership and IFS**

* Cultivating mindful self-leadership essential for healing from trauma
* Mindfulness allows compassionate and curious survey of internal landscape
* Effective leadership necessary for all systems, including internal system
* Internal leader distributes resources, provides vision for whole self

**Differences in Internal Systems**

* Absence of effective leadership in abuse victim's internal system
* Parts operate under extreme rules and outdated assumptions
* Fear of revealing childhood secrets

**Blending vs. Separation**

* **Blending**: Self identifies with a part
* "I want to kill myself" vs. "A part of me wishes that I were dead"
* Schwartz's assertions about mindful Self
	+ Undamaged essence exists beneath protective parts
	+ Confident, curious, and calm
	+ Spontaneously emerges when protectors trust it's safe
	+ Active leadership role in reorganizing inner system
	+ Increases control over emotional brain through mindfulness
* Neuroscience research supports active role of mindful Self
	+ Increases medial prefrontal cortex activation
	+ Decreases amygdala activation
* Inner relationship between Self and protective parts in IFS model
* Self acts as orchestra conductor, helping parts function harmoniously

### GETTING TO KNOW THE INTERNAL LANDSCAPE

Therapist's role is to help patients identify and separate protective parts from the Self.

**Identifying Protective Parts:**

* Patients ask each emerging part to "stand back" for self-observation.
* Unblending parts makes them less intimidating and overwhelming.
* Identify the part involved in current problem (e.g., feeling worthless, abandoned, or vengeful).
* Describe the part with an image (e.g., abandoned child, combat marine).

**Mindful Self-Observation:**

* Patients ask how they feel toward the protective part.
* Extreme responses indicate another protective part blended with Self.
* Thank and assure protective parts of their importance.
* Ask how patients feel toward the previously rejected part.
* Encourage getting to know the part better (e.g., age, origin).

**Dialogue with Protective Parts:**

* Patients engage in constructive inner dialogues from a stable Self perspective.
* Identify and address the protective parts interfering.
* Empathic comments or questions to facilitate self-reflection.
* Continuous self-detection question: "How do you feel toward the part now?"

### A LIFE IN PARTS

* **Joan's Issues:** Uncontrollable temper tantrums, guilt about affairs, defensiveness, vulnerability, anger, fear, and sorrow.
* **First Session:** Joan critiqued therapist's office, prepared for disappointment, needed to test therapist's ability to handle her emotions.
* **Therapist's Approach:** Showing interest in Joan's life, unwavering support, accepting shameful parts.
* **Identifying Critical Part:** Joan acknowledged the critical part and hated it due to its resemblance to her mother.
* **Protective Role of Critic:** Protecting Joan from criticism, preempting her mother's criticism.
* **Childhood Trauma:** Sexual molestation by mother's boyfriend around first or second grade.
* **Patterns in Adulthood:** Demanding and critical of husband, passionate and reckless in affairs, fearful and ashamed after sex.
* **Dissociation:** Specific memories of abuse were split off, reenacting the trauma unintentionally.
* **Therapy Approach:** Focus on Joan's relationship with her parts, not on therapist, pendulation, recruiting inner resources, self-healing.
* **Limitations of Therapist:** Cannot fill holes of early deprivation, wrong person, time, and place.

### MEETING THE MANAGERS

- **Identified various parts in charge of Joan's behavior**: aggressive childlike, promiscuous adolescent, suicidal, obsessive manager, prissy moralist, etc.
- Met managers first to understand their roles and responsibilities.
- Managers prevent humiliation and abandonment, keep organized and safe.
- Can be aggressive, perfectionistic, reserved, or deny reality.
- Control access to emotions and maintain defensive positions.
- Huge burden of responsibility, often incompetent but can be highly skilled.

**Characteristics of Managers**

- Prevent humiliation and abandonment.
- Keep organized and safe.
- Can be aggressive, perfectionistic, reserved, or deny reality.
- Control access to emotions.
- Maintain defensive positions.

**Impact of Managers on Joan's Life**

- Simultaneous experience of conflicting feelings and thoughts is normal.
- Realized that only a part of her felt consumed by hate.
- After negative evaluation, went into a tailspin, feeling powerless and worthless.
- Resisted acknowledging weak, powerless parts.
- Criticized herself, felt embarrassed and contemptuous.
- Felt suicidal and bulimic.

**Interaction with the Critic Manager**

- Wanted to ignore all noise and increase medications.
- Believed people would hate her and be alone if parts stepped back.
- Memory of mother's threat of adoption triggered fear and sadness.

**Impact of Managers on Joan's Healing Process**

- Unintentionally doing harm in their desire to protect injured parts.
- Asked managers what would happen if they stepped back.
- Felt bad for the scared girl inside, Self returned.
- Session was too much too soon, calmed system down but not enough.

### PUTTING OUT THE FLAMES

* Joan missed appointment due to exile being triggered
* **Firefighters went on rampage**: drinking, picking up strangers, refusing to talk to husband
* **Firefighters vs Managers**:
	+ Managers: stay in control
	+ Firefighters: destroy house to put out fire
* Struggle between managers and firefighters continues until exiles are cared for
* Anyone dealing with survivors will encounter firefighters
* Firefighters protect system from emotional pain
* **Firefighter behaviors**: shopping, drinking, addictive activities, impulsive affairs, self-harm
* Firefighters believe stopping their job would cause entire self-system to crash
* Firefighters oblivious to better ways for physical and emotional safety
* Cycles end when Self takes charge and system feels safe

### THE BURDEN OF TOXICITY: Exiles

* **Toxic Waste Dump:** Exiles are the part of the psyche that holds traumatic memories, sensations, beliefs, and emotions.
* **Hazardous to Release:** Releasing exiles is dangerous due to their association with trauma, terror, collapse, and accommodation.
* **Forms of Exiles:** Crushing physical sensations or extreme numbing.
* **Impact on Managers:** Overwhelms managers, leading to loss of reasonableness.
* **Impact on Firefighters:** Offends the bravado of firefighters who want to suppress emotions.
* **Hated and Despised:** Exiles are often hated and despised by survivors, particularly the parts that responded to abuse or were abandoned.
* **Being Overwhelmed:** When exiles overwhelm managers, the Self becomes "blended" with them, eclipsing all alternatives for life.
* **Loss of Sensitivity and Creativity:** Keeping exiles locked up stamps out not only memories and emotions but also the parts that hold them, leading to a life without intimacy or genuine joy.
* **Double Whammy:** The parts that hold the exiles are hurt twice**: by the original trauma and by being rejected and exiled.
* **Impact on Sensitive Parts:** These parts are often the most sensitive, creative, intimate, lively, playful, and innocent parts of a person.

### UNLOCKING THE PAST

**Unlocking the Past with Internal Family Systems (IFS)**

* Joan's treatment involved accessing the exiled girl carrying feelings from her molestation
* Girl had developed enough trust and self-awareness to observe herself as a child
* Important for Joan to keep girl in state of calm observation, prevent her from pulling away
* Encouraged Joan to take an active role in liberating her inner child
* Trauma resolution through accessing imagination and reworking frozen scenes

**IFS Helps Family Members "Mentor" Each Other**

* Witnessed this with Joan and her husband, Brian
* Initially proud of putting up with Joan's behavior, felt pressured by her desire for change
* Revealed panicked part that feared being overwhelmed by pain
* Grew up in an alcoholic family where dysfunctional behaviors were common
* Fearful of women and determined to never let himself be vulnerable
* Strong caretaker part gave him self-worth, purpose, and a way to deal with terror

**Brian's Exile: The Scared, Essentially Motherless Child**

* Ready to meet his exile after dealing with other parts
* New possibilities opened up for both Joan and Brian
* IFS helped them hear each other from an objective, compassionate perspective
* No longer locked in the past.

### THE POWER OF SELF-COMPASSION: IFS IN THE TREATMENT OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

**Nancy Shadick** is a rheumatologist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital with an interest in patients' personal experience of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

* RA is an autoimmune disease causing chronic pain, disability, and impaired quality of life; no cure, only medication for symptom relief
* **IFS** (Internal Family Systems) therapy introduced to help patients accept and understand their emotions, taught in a nine-month study
* **Group sessions**: teach patients to recognize and approach internal states with interest and compassion
* Patients were alexithymic, denying pain and emotions due to stoic parts
* IFS helped patients identify and communicate with managers, exiles, and firefighters
* Individual therapy applied IFS language to daily issues, improving self-compassion and self-efficacy
* **Study results**: IFS group showed improvements in self-assessed pain, physical function, self-compassion, depression, and overall pain relative to control group at 9 months
* Improvements sustained for one year, although medical tests could no longer detect measurable improvements
* **Conclusion**: IFS's focus on self-compassion key factor in improved ability to live with disease
* Previous studies showed psychological interventions (CBT, mindfulness) had positive impact on RA patients but didn't address immune system function.

## CHAPTER 18
### FILLING IN THE HOLES: CREATING STRUCTURES

* Trauma survivors face inner voids or "holes in the soul" due to lack of love, validation, and feeling unwanted or ignored during childhood.
* Conventional psychotherapy may not be effective for those who did not feel safe or cared for as children.
* Attended US Association for Body Psychotherapy conference in 1994 and met Albert Pesso, who claimed to have a way of changing people's relationship with their core selves.
* **Pesso's PBSP psychomotor therapy involves**:
  * Witnessing and validating the protagonist's experiences
  * Creating tableaus or structures in three-dimensional space
    + Significant people from the past are represented by group members
    + Ideal parents provide support, love, and protection
  * Protagonists direct their own plays
* **Benefits**:
  * Instills imprints of safety and comfort alongside those of trauma
  * Communication primarily occurs in nonverbal realm (right hemisphere)
  * Contact person's presence helps protagonist tolerate painful experiences
* Visited Pesso at his farmhouse for a structure session.
  + Chose objects to represent significant people in my life
  + Revealed implicit map of the world: two large, threatening objects representing parents and small objects representing family and friends
  + Felt deep release when Al interposed himself between me and the threatening objects.

### RESTRUCTURING INNER MAPS

* Projecting inner world into 3D structures for clearer perspective on reactions
* Position placeholders for important people in life, eliciting memories, thoughts, emotions
* No explanation or interpretation of past, allows re-experiencing and visualization
* Can rewrite crucial scenes, direct role-players to do things left undone
* Safety of group allows exploration of hidden, shameful experiences
* Placing shame on rightful figures, saying suppressed words
* Active participation and taking charge of representation
* Witness reflects changes in posture, facial expression, tone of voice
* Physically re-experiencing past in present, creating new supplemental memories
* Structures do not erase bad memories but offer fresh options for fulfilling needs and longings.

### REVISING THE PAST

**Maria's Trauma Healing Experience**

* Maria, a Filipina woman in her mid-40s, appeared scared during a trauma exploration workshop
* She reported feeling numb and having a blank mind

**Witness Figure:**

* Validates protagonist's emotions
* Encourages focus on breath and body feelings
* Reflects emotional state and context
* Creates a safe environment for exploration

**Maria's Childhood:**

* Grew up with fear of her father
* Never felt cared for by him
* Mother was loving but unable to protect her from father's abuse
* Felt trapped and incapable of protecting herself

**Ideal Parents:**

* Represented by group members (Ellen as mother, Danny as father)
* Enacted roles of caring, protective parents
* Allowed Maria to express desires for a different upbringing
* Created a sense of joy and safety for Maria

**Impact on Group:**

* Several group members wept silently during the exercise
* The possibility of growing up safe and happy resonated with their own longings.

### RESCRIPTING YOUR LIFE

* **Growing up with ideal circumstances is rare**
* **Defects in childhood upbringing can lead to:**
  + Lack of self-respect
  + Difficulty standing up for oneself
  + Smoldering rage
  + Interpreting others' actions as threats
  + Inability to appreciate others' complexities
* **Trauma and neglect disconnect people from their bodies**
* **People trapped in a matrix of fear, isolation, and scarcity:**
  + Anticipate rejection and hurt
  + Reluctant to try new options
* **Value of structured experiences like psychomotor therapy:**
  + Safe exploration of inner reality
  + Concrete "aha moments"
  + Transformation of inner narratives
* **Structures harness the power of imagination:**
  + Disclosure of hidden secrets
  + Transformation of feared and forbidden into concrete reality
* **Importance of accurate mirroring:**
  + Permission to feel and know
  + Essential foundation of recovery
* **Trauma causes people to remain stuck in the past**
* **Structures represent the structure of inner world:**
  + Internal map and hidden rules.

### DARING TO TELL THE TRUTH

* Mark, a 26-year-old man, overheard his father having an affair with his aunt at age 13
* Tried to discuss it with his father but was met with rage and denial
* Felt confused, embarrassed, hurt, betrayed, and isolated
* Father's hypocrisy contaminated family life, gave him a sense of distrust
* Spent adolescence feeling disconnected from others
* Mother died when he was 21, father married the aunt, Mark was not invited to funeral or wedding
* Secrets became inner toxins, affecting every aspect of his life

**Group Therapy Session:**

* Mark stood out for emotional distance, acknowledged feeling separated by a fog

### ANTIDOTES TO PAINFUL MEMORIES

- Psychomotor therapy offers the possibility of forming virtual memories that contradict painful realities of the past
- People need to become viscerally familiar with sensations rooted in safety, mastery, delight, and connection
- Dreaming creates associations that reweave the past, psychomotor structures do the same but are subject to laws of physics
- Healing tableaus of structures offer an experience of being welcomed, protected, met needs, and feeling at home

**Benefits of Psychomotor Therapy**

- Forms virtual memories that live side by side with painful realities
- Provides sensory experiences contradicting static feelings of trauma
- Offers intense and real emotional scenarios to defuse old ones
- Creates a world where people delight, protect, meet needs, and make feel at home

**Functions of Psychomotor Therapy**

- Replaces frustrating events with sensations rooted in safety and connection
- Contradicts painful memories with new emotional experiences
- Offers an experience of being welcomed and protected

**Limitations of Psychomotor Therapy**

- Cannot undo past events, but can create new emotional scenarios to defuse old ones.

## CHAPTER 19
### REWIRING THE BRAIN: NEUROFEEDBACK

* **Working at Hartmann's Sleep Laboratory**
  * Part-time research assistant
  * Prepared and monitored participants
  * Analyzed EEG tracings
  * Documented dreams
  * Used intercom to wake participants during REM sleep cycles
  * Pored over EEGs, recorded baseball scores, filled out questionnaires

* **Contributions to Understanding Sleep Processes**
  * Documented REM sleep and dreaming
  * Contributed to basic understanding of sleep processes
  * Led to crucial discoveries (Chapter 15)

* **Unrealized Hope for EEG in Understanding Psychiatric Problems**
  * Long-standing hope that EEG would help understand psychiatric problems
  * Realization largely unachieved

### MAPPING THE ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS OF THE BRAIN

* Before pharmacological revolution, both chemical and electrical signals important for brain activity
* **Hans Berger**: first recording of brain's electrical activity in 1924 using electroencephalography (EEG)
* Initially met with skepticism but became essential tool for diagnosing seizure activity in epilepsy patients

**Different brain-wave patterns reflect different mental activities**
* Berger hoped to correlate psychiatric problems with specific EEG irregularities
* **Early 1930s**: EEG findings in "behavior problem children" with slow frontal lobe electrical activity linked to ADHD
* **Mid-late 1980s**: Sent patients for EEGs to determine emotional instability, but results were ambiguous and unhelpful
* **2000**: McFarlane et al. study documented differences in information processing between traumatized subjects and "normal" individuals using the oddball paradigm
	+ Traumatized brains had loosely coordinated brain waves, failing to generate coherent patterns for filtering, focus, and analysis
	+ Lack of N200 wave: difficulty paying attention on task at hand by filtering out irrelevant information
	+ Poorly defined core information-processing configuration (P300)
* Implications for understanding day-to-day information processing in traumatized individuals

**McFarlane's study reminded author of Pierre Janet's statement**: 
> Traumatic stress is an illness of not being able to be fully alive in the present

* The Hurt Locker movie illustrates the focus and attention problems in PTSD veterans
* **2007**: Met Sebern Fisher, who used neurofeedback for treating severely disturbed adolescents with dramatic results
* **Neurofeedback**: non-invasive treatment that trains individuals to control their brain waves
* Author's firsthand experience of neurofeedback demonstration and its dramatic impact on mental functioning.

### SEEING THE SYMPHONY OF THE BRAIN


**Neurofeedback:** a brain training technique using real-time information about brain activity to "train" the brain to function optimally.

* Equipment: desktop computers, amplifier, electrodes
* Principle: provides mirror of brain function, nudges brain to make more of certain frequencies and less of others
* Process:
	+ Electrodes placed on head to detect brain waves
	+ Computer displays brain wave patterns as feedback (e.g., spaceships)
	+ User adjusts mental state to influence feedback
	+ Goal: develop new, complex, self-regulating brain patterns
* Benefits:
	+ Enhances natural complexity and self-regulation
	+ Frees up stuck oscillatory properties
	+ Allows new ones to develop
* Similarities with conversation:
	+ User responds based on feedback (smiles, nods)
	+ Inhibition is neutral instead of negative
* Additional feature: tracks circuitry in specific brain areas
	+ Rewards specific frequencies in different regions
	+ Affects mental and physical sensations

**Neurofeedback and Trauma:**

* **Goal**: intervene in fear and shame circuits, reduce automatic stress reactions
* **Benefits**:
	+ Relaxes fear patterns
	+ Increases resiliency
	+ Allows for more choices in response to events
* **Neurofeedback as treatment**:
	+ Changes habitual brain patterns created by trauma
	+ Stabilizes the brain and increases focus on ordinary events
	+ Reduces susceptibility to stress reactions.

### THE BIRTH OF NEUROFEEDBACK

* Neurofeedback not new in 2007, with roots dating back to late 1950s
* University of Chicago professor Joe Kamiya discovered people could learn to produce alpha waves associated with relaxation (1950s)
	+ Reached 100% accuracy in identifying alpha waves within 4 days
	+ Could voluntarily enter alpha state in response to sound cue
* Alpha training for stress relief became widely known after Psychology Today article (1968)

**Early Scientific Research on Neurofeedback**

* **Barry Sterman at UCLA**: studied effects of rocket fuel monomethylhydrazine (MMH) on cats (1970s)
	+ Ordinary lab cats developed seizures after MMH exposure
	+ Cats with neurofeedback training did not develop seizures
	+ Neurofeedback stabilized their brains
* **First human study**: Mary Fairbanks, epileptic patient, became virtually seizure-free after 3 months of training (1971)
* Impressive results published in Epilepsia (1978)

**Decline and Revival of Neurofeedback**

* Optimism about human mind's potential waned in the mid-1970s
* Psychiatry and brain science adopted chemical model of mind and brain
* Neurofeedback field grew slowly, with much research done outside US
* Limited commercial potential and insurance coverage hinder widespread acceptance
	+ Expensive for consumers
	+ Prevents practitioners from conducting large-scale studies

### FROM A HOMELESS SHELTER TO THE NURSING STATION

**Lisa's Journey**

* Lisa, a 27-year-old nursing student, shared her remarkable story with the author
* Lisa possessed great resilience and was an engaging, curious, intelligent person
* Grew up in an abusive household with an unpredictable mother
* Father abandoned family when she was three years old
* Endured physical and emotional abuse, spent years in mental hospitals, group homes, foster families, and on the street
* Lack of language to communicate her experiences led to a reputation as manipulative liar
* Could not remember self-inflicted injuries or recognize herself in a mirror
* Suffered from dissociative identity disorder (DID) and inescapable shock

**Neurofeedback Treatment**

* Invited by Sebern for neurofeedback sessions
* Impossible to do talk therapy
* Frequent panic attacks and memory loss when discussing past experiences
* Stuck in a state of inescapable shock
* First dissociative patient for neurofeedback treatment
* Rewarded more coherent brain patterns in right temporal lobe (fear center)
* Noticed improvement in social anxiety and fear of basements
* Stopped dissociating after half a year of neurofeedback sessions
* Developed a more continuous sense of self
* Able to talk about past experiences for the first time
* No longer feared attachment or memorizing people out of fear

**Impact of Neurofeedback**

* Clearer and able to focus
* Able to meaningfully connect with others
* Stunning potential for neurofeedback treatment in trauma recovery

### GETTING STARTED IN NEUROFEEDBACK

**Training Session Experience**

- Michael reported feeling safe and open after session
- Placed electrode over sensorimotor strip on right side of head
- Rewarded frequency of 11-14 Hz
- Michael shared remarkable experience with group
- Emerged from low profile, became valuable contributor to neurofeedback program

**Study with 17 Patients**

- Targeted right temporal area of brain due to excessive activation during traumatic stress
- Twenty neurofeedback sessions over ten weeks
- Difficult to get self-reports from patients due to alexithymia
- Objective changes in behavior better indicators of treatment success
- Significant improvements in PTSD scores, interpersonal comfort, emotional balance, and self-awareness

**First Patient's Experience**

- Professional man with compulsive homosexual behavior
- Previous therapy unsuccessful
- Neurofeedback training led to new behaviors, such as fishing instead of cruising
- Brain may have derived comfort from fishing due to changed connectivity patterns

**Neurofeedback Effects on the Brain**

- Neurofeedback changes brain connectivity patterns
- Mind follows by creating new patterns of engagement

### BRAIN-WAVE BASICS FROM SLOW TO FAST

**Brain waves range from slow to fast**: Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta

**Delta Waves (2-5 Hz)**

* Slowest brain waves, most common during sleep
* Brain is in idling state, mind turned inward
* Excessive delta activity during wakefulness leads to foggy thinking and poor judgment
* Linked to ADHD and PTSD

**Theta Waves (5-8 Hz)**

* Predominate at edge of sleep and in hypnotic trance states
* Create unconstrained frame of mind for novel connections and associations
* Used in alpha/theta training for PTSD treatment
* Occur during out-of-it or depressed states

**Alpha Waves (8-12 Hz)**

* Accompanied by sense of peace and calm
* Familiar to mindfulness meditation practitioners
* Used to help people achieve focused relaxation
* Walter Reed National Military Medical Center uses alpha training for PTSD treatment

**Beta Waves (13-20 Hz)**

* Fastest brain waves, brain oriented to outside world
* Enable focused attention during tasks
* High beta (over 20 Hz) associated with agitation, anxiety, and body tenseness.

### HELPING THE BRAIN TO FOCUS

**Neurofeedback Training:**

- Improves creativity, athletic control, inner awareness (even for highly accomplished individuals)
- Studied more thoroughly for performance enhancement than psychiatric problems

**Sports Medicine:**

- Boston University's only department familiar with neurofeedback
- Len Zaichkowsky, sports psychologist, used neurofeedback to train Vancouver Canucks

**Performance Enhancement:**

- Neurofeedback studied extensively for performance enhancement
- AC Milan soccer club used it to help players remain focused and relaxed
- Increased mental and physiological control led to wins in 2006 World Cup and European championship (AC Milan)
- Included in Canada's $117 million, five-year plan for 2010 Winter Olympics

**Musical Performance:**

- Neurofeedback benefits focus, attention, and concentration
- Students who received neurofeedback training had a 10% improvement in music performance (Britain’s Royal College of Music study)

**Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD):**

- At least thirty-six studies show neurofeedback is an effective and time-limited treatment for ADHD
- As effective as conventional drugs
- No further treatment necessary once brain has been trained to produce different patterns of electrical communication

### WHERE IS THE PROBLEM IN MY BRAIN?

**qEEG Analysis:**

- Sophisticated computerized EEG analysis (quantitative EEG or qEEG)
- Traces brain-wave activity millisecond by millisecond
- Converts activity into a color map of frequency levels in key brain areas
- Shows communication between brain regions
- Large databases available for comparison with other individuals
- Relatively inexpensive and portable compared to fMRI scans

**qEEG and DSM Diagnostic Categories:**

- qEEG evidence shows arbitrary boundaries of current mental illness labels (DSM)
- Mental states common to multiple diagnoses, such as confusion or agitation, have specific qEEG patterns
- More problems a patient has, the more abnormalities in the qEEG

**Benefits of qEEG for Patients:**

- Helps patients understand localized electrical activity in their brains
- Explains difficulty focusing and lack of emotional control
- Shifts focus from self-blame to learning new processing methods
- Empowering experience of changing brain activity with the mind

**Interpreting qEEG Results:**

- **Training to increase presentness**: patients can see progress in real time
- Benefits accumulate when feedback is related to specific behaviors or actions.

### HOW DOES TRAUMA CHANGE BRAIN WAVES?

**Trauma and Brain Waves**

- Traumatized individuals show various qEEG patterns in neurofeedback lab
  - **Hyperaroused emotional brains dominate mental life**: excessive right temporal lobe activity, frontal slow-wave activity
  - Calming fear center decreases trauma-based problems, improves executive functioning
  - Other patients panic when closing eyes, train to produce more relaxed brain patterns
  - Overreact to sounds and light, focus on changing communication patterns at the back of the brain

**Alexander McFarlane's Research**

- Studying how combat changes previously normal brains
- Australian Department of Defence asked for mental and biological functioning study
- Measured qEEG in 179 combat troops before and after each deployment to Middle East
- **Decrease in alpha power at the back of the brain with more months in combat**
  - Area monitors body state, regulates sleep and hunger
  - Decrease reflects persistent agitation
- **Brain waves at front of brain show progressive slowing with each deployment**
  - Soldiers develop frontal-lobe activity resembling ADHD
  - Interferes with executive functioning and focused attention
- **Arousal no longer helps soldiers focus on ordinary tasks, only makes them agitated and restless**
- Unknown if any soldiers will develop PTSD or degree to which brains will readjust to civilian life

### NEUROFEEDBACK AND LEARNING DISABILITIES

- Childhood trauma interferes with proper wiring of sensory-integration systems
- **Result**: Learning disabilities, affecting auditory-word processing and hand-eye coordination
- Behavioral problems often mask learning difficulties
- Trauma disrupts basic processing functions (e.g., getting lost, auditory delay)

**Impact on Learning:**

- Difficulty following instructions
- Inability to concentrate
- Disorganization in time and space management
- Lack of attention and focus

**Neurofeedback as a Solution:**

- Helps reverse learning disabilities
- Improves ability to keep track of things (maps, schedules)
- Enhances organization skills
- Potential for activating neuroplasticity after critical periods

**Challenges in Brain and Mind Science:**

- Assisting individuals in organizing time and space if early trauma has interfered with their development
- Limited success with drugs or conventional therapy in addressing these issues
- Urgent need to study the potential of neurofeedback as an alternative intervention.

### ALPHA-THETA TRAINING

**Alpha-Theta Training**

* Neurofeedback procedure to induce hypnagogic states
* Predomination of theta waves leads to focus on internal world
* Alpha brain waves act as bridge between external and internal worlds
* Frequencies alternately rewarded in alpha-theta training

**PTSD and Alpha-Theta Training**

* Open mind to new possibilities, loosen conditioned connections
* Twilight states foster safe reexperiencing of traumatic events
* New associations created, potential for fresh perspective

**Study on Alpha-Theta Training and PTSD**

* 29 Vietnam veterans with chronic combat-related PTSD
* 15 assigned to EEG alpha-theta training, 14 to control group
* Neurofeedback facilitated twilight states by rewarding alpha and theta waves
* Participants guided into deep relaxation, asked to use positive mental imagery
* **Outcomes**:
  * Neurofeedback group had significant decrease in PTSD symptoms, physical complaints, depression, anxiety, paranoia
  * Only three neurofeedback-treated veterans reported disturbing flashbacks and nightmares
  * Fourteen out of fifteen used significantly less medication
* Comparison group experienced increase in PTSD symptoms, hospitalizations, and medication use
* **Study replicated by other researchers but received little attention outside neurofeedback community.**

### NEUROFEEDBACK, PTSD, AND ADDICTION

- Approximately one-third to one-half of severely traumatized people develop substance abuse problems (Trauma and Substance Abuse)
  - Soldiers have used alcohol to cope with trauma since ancient times
  - Motor vehicle accident victims have a high risk of developing drug or alcohol problems

**PTSD and Substance Abuse are linked (Circular Relationship)**
  - Drugs and alcohol provide temporary relief from trauma symptoms
  - Withdrawal increases hyperarousal, intensifying PTSD symptoms
- **Two ways to break the cycle**: Resolve PTSD symptoms or treat hyperarousal
  - EMDR is one method for resolving PTSD symptoms
  - Naltrexone is sometimes used to reduce hyperarousal but not effective in all cases

**Case Study: Neurofeedback and Cocaine Addiction**

- Woman with history of childhood sexual abuse, addiction to cocaine (Severe Trauma and Drug Abuse)
- Quick recovery after two neurofeedback sessions (Recovery from Drug Abuse)
- Few studies on neurofeedback for addiction in recent years (Limited Research)

**Study: Neurofeedback and PTSD with Alcoholism**

- Study by Peniston and Kulkosky on veterans with dual diagnoses of alcoholism and PTSD (Dual Diagnosis)
- Fifteen veterans received alpha-theta training, control group received standard treatment without neurofeedback
- **Follow-up for three years**: Eight members of neurofeedback group stopped drinking completely, one relapsed but didn't drink again, most were less depressed (Effective Results)
- Control group was readmitted to the hospital within eighteen months (Ineffective Results)

**Conclusion**

- Neurofeedback shows promise in treating addiction and PTSD
- More research is needed to establish potential and limitations

### THE FUTURE OF NEUROFEEDBACK

**Neurofeedback** **and its applications**:

- Used for developmental trauma, tension headaches, traumatic brain injury, anxiety, panic attacks, meditation, autism, seizure control, mood disorders, etc.
- Used in military and VA facilities to treat PTSD.
- Wide spectrum of efficacy, according to research.
- Neurofeedback plays a major therapeutic role (Frank Duffy).
- Questions remain about treatment protocols.

**Shift in scientific paradigm:**

- Thomas Insel's call for understanding mind and brain in terms of electrical communication.
- NIMH re-orienting research towards "disorders of the human connectome."
- Mapping the connectome to decipher electrical signals.

**Lisa's experience with Neurofeedback:**

- Calmed down, stopped dissociation.
- Emotions have meaning, not always anxious or in fight-or-flight mode.
- Lowered blood pressure, freed up to live life.
- Graduated top of nursing school class and works full time as a nurse.

## EPILOGUE
### CHOICES TO BE MADE

**We are on the brink of becoming a trauma-conscious society.**

Advances in neuroscience provide a better understanding of how trauma affects brain development, self-regulation, and attention.

**Importance of a Healthy Society and Safe Childhood**

* Feeling abandoned, worthless, or invisible leads to fear, destruction of curiosity and playfulness
* Healthy society requires children who can safely play and learn
* Growth requires curiosity and adaptability through exploration
* Over 50% of Head Start children have experienced three or more adverse childhood experiences (ACE study)
* Safe and meaningfully connected individuals less likely to engage in destructive behaviors
* Child abuse and neglect is preventable cause of mental illness, drug/alcohol abuse, and leading causes of death

**Impact of Trauma on Children and Adolescents**

* Trauma can lead to feelings of helplessness, susceptibility to harmful influences
* Trauma is the single most preventable cause of mental illness, drug/alcohol abuse, and significant contributors to various health issues
* **Focus of work**: children and adolescents
* National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) established in 2001 with over 150 centers nationwide
* Comprehensive programs for traumatized, abused, and neglected children

**Transforming Schools into Safe Havens**

* **Teachers' initial response**: "I came here to be a teacher, not a social worker"
* Trauma-focused interventions can transform school culture
* Recognizing and understanding trauma effects on children
* Fostering safety, predictability, and being known and seen
* Greeting children by name, face-to-face contact, check-ins, modeling new ways of communication
* Acknowledging and addressing the cause of disturbing behaviors instead of punishment
* Predictability, clarity of expectations, consistency
* **Translating brain science into everyday practice**: calming down, safe areas, sensory awareness.

**Self-Regulation and Emotional Intelligence for Children:**

* Kids as young as three can learn self-regulation through practices like blowing soap bubbles and focusing on breath.
* Older children need help "befriending" their bodies to deal with disruptive physical sensations and emotional reactions.
* Self-awareness, self-regulation, and communication are essential skills for children alongside academic subjects.
* Mirroring exercises help kids identify emotions and learn interpersonal communication.
* Reciprocity and safe interpersonal communication promote relaxation and focus.
* Simple activities like playing games or keeping a beach ball in the air can improve focus and cohesion.
* Engaging in communal efforts, such as sports, music, or theater, promotes agency and community.

**Interventions for Children:**

* Mirroring exercises to identify emotions and learn interpersonal communication.
* Computer games to help focus and improve heart rate variability.
* Athletics, music, dance, and theatrical performances promote agency and community.
* Intense communal efforts force kids to collaborate, compromise, and stay focused on tasks.

**Success Stories:**

* Children become less anxious, emotionally reactive, aggressive, or withdrawn.
* Improved school performance and attention deficit issues.
* Parents report better sleep and increased ability to seek help.
* Interventions draw on natural wellsprings of cooperation, safety, reciprocity, and imagination.

**The Importance of Trauma:**

* Trauma reveals our fragility and man's inhumanity but also our resilience.
* Visionaries and societies have made profound advances from dealing with trauma.
* **Trauma is now the most urgent public health issue, and we have the knowledge to respond effectively.**

## APPENDIX
### CONSENSUS PROPOSED CRITERIA FOR DEVELOPMENTAL TRAUMA DISORDER
