## SECTION 2: CHAKRAS IN DEPTH. HISTORICAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND CROSS-CULTURAL UNDERSTANDINGS

* Recap of chakras as pulsing points of light and key to health, connection, and spiritual enlightenment
* Origin and history of chakra knowledge primarily from ancient India
* Chakras and their companions (subtle energies, body, energetic anatomies, kundalini) are explainable through scientific perspectives

## Part 4: Chakra Knowledge Through the Lens of Ancient India

* Chakras first mentioned in the earliest Vedic sacred scriptures
  * Vedas consist primarily of four main bodies of scripture called the Samhrita 
* **Contemporary chakra knowledge divided into three bodies**: Vedic, tantric, and yogic
  * Vedic tradition is orthodox and based on primary Vedic scriptures
  * Tantric tradition is shamanic and may incorporate Vedic scripture or other cultural beliefs
  * Yoga is a complete approach to life and ideals have become inseparable from chakra knowledge

## 16. ANCIENT VEDIC SCRIPTURES. THE FOUR CANNON
**Ancient Vedic Scriptures: The Four Canons of the Vedas**

* **Four main canons of the Vedas**: Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, Atharva Veda
* Written in Sanskrit, oldest known written language
* Contain germ of Hindu philosophy, cosmology, and practices
* Considered shruti (revealed knowledge) or smriti (remembered knowledge)

**Rig Veda**

* "Royal knowledge"
* Collection of hymns and prose mantras
* Addresses nature and deities
* Contains Samhita, Brahmanas, Upanishads, and Aranyakas

**Sama Veda**

* "Knowledge of chants"
* Deals with musical notation and performance
* Includes the Sama-Vedic tradition of chanting hymns

**Yajur Veda**

* "Knowledge of ritual"
* Provides instructions for performing rituals
* Contains mantras, formulas, and procedures

**Atharva Veda**

* "Knowledge of incarnations"
* Offers protection from evil and disease
* Includes spells, charms, and curses

**Vedic Scriptures Organization**

* **Samhita**: Collection of mantras and hymns
* **Brahmanas**: Explanation of mantras and rituals
* **Upanishads**: Philosophical and metaphysical writings
* **Aranyakas**: Forest texts dealing with mysticism, philosophy, and symbolism

**Origin and Authorship**

* **Debate on originators**: indigenous to East Indian region or brought by poets from elsewhere
* Hindu-based chakra teachings originated in Indus Valley (India, Pakistan, Afghanistan)
* Thousands of Hindu sects with diverse beliefs and writings
* Four main Vedas are oldest known texts, written in Sanskrit

**Additional Context**

* Spiritual ideas and concepts percolating in other parts of the world during this time
* Hindu cosmology and deities introduction
* Foundation for understanding chakras and related systems from a Hindu perspective and others.

**The remembered texts, the smriti**

* The Smriti texts, including the Dharma Sutras and Puranas, provide explanations and instructions for the Shruti (revealed) writings.
* Dharma Sutras are manuals of laws dealing with human relations, composed as threads or strings of rules. 
* **Puranas are post-Vedic writings that narrate the history of the universe, gods, kings, and heroes, organized into three categories**: Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva.
* Bhagavad Gita, a "song of God" composed around 200 BCE, discusses the purpose of life between Krishna and Arjuna. 
* **Debate among scholars on the timeline of the four main Vedic texts**: Rig Veda (oldest), Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, Atharva Veda.
* Rig Veda is the oldest compilation of wisdom in the world, origin of much Hindu culture, and difficult to date due to oral tradition and uncertain authorship.
* Scholarly suggestions place the writing or sharing of the Vedas between 12,000 BCE and 1000 BCE.
* Rig Veda is a complex collection of 1,028 hymns addressing various deities, arranged in ten mandalas (circles/universes). 
* **The other three main Vedic texts**: Yajur Veda (composed between 1400 and 1100 BCE), Sama Veda (composition date uncertain), Atharva Veda (between 1100 and 900 BCE).
* Not all content in these scriptures was complete by their accepted composition dates.
* The most vital early text is the Rig Veda, which serves as the source material for the other three Vedas.

### THE PEOPLE BEHIND VEDIC SCRIPTURE: WHO WAS THERE “IN THE BEGINNING”?

**Origins of Vedic Scripture**
 
* **Aryans**: Indo-European people from central Russia (4500-1500 bce)
  * Spread to Indus Valley around 2000 bce
  * Believed in an invisible force, the Creator
* Harappan Civilization (Indus Valley)
  * Peaked between 2300 and 2000 bce
 * **Two main cities**: Mahenjo-Daro and Harappa
  * Left behind mother goddess figures, lingams, and yoga pose
* Aryans and Harappans
  * Both believed in an invisible force
  * Differences in beliefs around 1500 bce
    * Aryans adopted Indra, god of war and agni (fire)
    * Harappans preferred Varuna, god of order 
* **Vedic scripture**: Amalgamation of various cultural sources
  * Absorbed Harappan philosophies
  * Local divinities became associated with Aryan gods
* Debate on the origin of Vedic scriptural knowledge
  * Some believe Aryans brought most information
    * Evidence of chariots and yoking in Vedas
  * Others argue for Harappan origins
    * Mathematical evidence from Sulbasutras
    * Geographical evidence: Sarasvati River mentioned in Rig Veda
* David Frawley's alternative view
  * Indus Valley continually occupied by Aryans before 2400 bce
  * Archeological and astronomical evidence supports this theory
* Importance of determining true authorship
  * Could challenge the timeline of ancient cultures
  * Vedic Scripture could be the most authentic view of the ancient world.

### A Key Philosophy of the Vedic Scriptures: The Yugas

* Vedic scriptures illustrate the concept of the Yugas, or ages, in Hindu philosophy 
* **Four major yugas**: Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga
* Each yuga lasts between 4.1-8.2 billion years, representing one life cycle of Brahman
* We have been de-evolving throughout the ages, with truth, wisdom, knowledge, life span, and emotional/intellectual intelligence declining 
* **Satya Yuga**: golden age of truth, virtue, religion, long life, and self-realization through meditation (lasted longer than other yugas) 
* **Treta Yuga**: silver age of decline in morals and virtues, long life, and self-realization through great sacrifices 
* **Dvapara Yuga**: copper age of further consciousness reduction, living for a thousand years, and self-realization through temple worship 
* **Kali Yuga**: iron age of vice, strife, discord, argument, loss of spiritual awareness, identification with physical selves only, and shrinking wisdom (current epoch) 
* **Predictions in Vishnu Purana about the characteristics of Kali Yuga**: minds occupied with wealth, corruption as means of subsistence.

### IS THERE HOPE?

**Lord Vishnu and His Avatars**

- Lord Vishnu is the supreme god in Hinduism, responsible for preserving the universe
- Ten avatars of Vishnu appear in each epoch
- One avatar of this age is Lord Krishna
- Vedic scriptures compiled by Vyasedeva at the beginning of Kali Yuga to preserve wisdom

**Accessing Divine Light and Salvation**

- Understanding scripture and seeking salvation not dependent on teachers or religious leaders
- Embracing scriptural wisdom through darsan (seeing), immediate perception, and knowing
- Each individual must evolve and "fly" on their own

**The Concept of Chakras**

- First appearance of the term "chakra" in Rig Veda
- Originally used to refer to a cart wheel or technical knowledge
- Later spiritual symbolism ascribed to chakras in Upanishads
- Used as a symbol for dynamism and movement, including the rotation of Vishnu as a chakra

**The Meaning of Chakra in the Rig Veda**

- Technical term for a cart wheel
- Process for irrigation through an iron wheel called a cakra
- Symbol of dynamism and movement
- Label for the wheel of a chariot, often associated with the dawn or creation's axis
- Used to describe god Vishnu as a rotating chakra holding the three worlds together

chakras were considered spiritual organs even in the Rig Veda. 
 
* **Chakras mentioned in Rig Veda**:

    * Seven worlds, rivers, sages, wisdoms, pranas
    * Gods have seven spears and seven lights (7.28.5)
  * **Connection to meditation and subtle body**
    * Ayasya Angirasa mentions meditation through seven chakras and four states of consciousness
    * Interpretation of sun symbolism and yoga practice
 
* **Chakras in Atharva Veda**:
  * City of god Ayodhya represented by eight "cakras" and nine gates
  * Achieving eternal peace through following tenets (yog)
 
* **Linguistic similarities between Vedic civilizations and other cultures**:
  * Use of term "garuda" for thunderbird eagles in Siberia and among Lakota Sioux
  * Ancient Indian migration to America and development of civilization
    * Similarities in deities, calendar concepts, and languages
 
* **Symbols important to Vedas and Hinduism found in other parts of the world**:
  * Omphalus (stone representing center of the world) in Greece
    * Shape resembles Shiva lingam with tantric symbols
    * Connection to navel and creator god Brahma emerging from Vishnu's navel
 * **Overall suggestion**: Ancient India as the cradle of civilization with a unified worldview.

### The Evolution of the Hindu Gods
**The Evolution of Hindu Gods and Their Relation to Chakras**

* The Hindu pantheon plays a significant role in understanding chakra symbolism.
* In this text, we'll outline some deities and their appearances throughout different eras.

**Early Vedic Deities (circa 1500 BCE)**

## 17. CHAKRAS TAKING FORM: DIVINING THREE MOVEMENTS FROM THE UPANISHADS AND OTHER EARLY SACRED TEXTS
 
* **Vedic scripture**: four primary Vedas, focus on liberating soul from body through mental training

**Orthodox Hindu philosophy:**
- Seeks to liberate soul from body
- Emerged from Vedas
- Tantra and yoga also emerged around same time

**Tantra:**

### A PRIMER ON ENERGY: TOWARD A WORKING DEFINITION

**Energy as Information**

* Energy is a force that accomplishes work, but for this text, energy is defined as information that moves
* Information and energy are one and the same (Paul Pearsall's The Heart’s Code)
* Everything contains and emanates instructional and intentional information
* Chakras respond to and store this information

**Vibration and Frequency**

* Absolutely everything vibrates or moves, creating unique waves or frequencies
* Vibration is one full oscillation; frequency is the periodic speed at which something vibrates
* Our five senses detect gross vibrations, but chakras sense subtle ones
* Vibration may control bodily health and function at a molecular level (Dr. Colin W. F. McClare)

**Classical Physics (Macro Perspective)**

* Sir Isaac Newton's explanation of weighted physical objects and their properties
* Classical physics describes the universe from a macro perspective
* Energy with mass or physicality is still information in constant motion
* Chakras have been measured and found to fit within this framework

**Orange Physics (Micro Perspective)**

* Deals with the micro-universe and quanta, the smallest packets of energy
* Pure energy has a field around it; the more vibrating energy is compressed, the more intense the vibration
* In quantum land, we find chakras most comfortable due to their magical qualities
* Energy exists as potential but not "real" matter until it's measured or turns into matter in a unified field or subtle matrix.

### THE APPLE UNIVERSE: CLASSICAL PHYSICS

- **Materialistic view of reality**: "what you see is what you get"
- Within the confines of the apple universe, objects have definite properties and behave according to natural laws
- Sir Isaac Newton's influence on this way of thinking
  * Discoveries in science and mathematics
  * Associated with apples and discovery of gravity

**Key Concepts from the Apple Universe**
 
* **Materialistic View of Reality**: What is tangible and observable defines reality

### Level Two: The “Charge” of Relationships 

- Physical reality is composed of particles, waves, and fields
- Atoms are the largest observable parts of matter, made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons
- Protons and electrons have charge (positive and negative respectively), which creates bonding and electricity
- Neutrons are neutral and do not have charge
- Electrical charge is vital in energetics and can create electricity
- Our bodies and kundalini are electrical generators, and life comes down to electricity or charge
- Charge connects particles and creates bonding through attraction to oppositely charged mates
- **Ancient Hindu belief**: chakras are plugged into the spine and brain, our electrically charged central nervous system
- Electrons generate electrical charge by jumping from atom to atom due to an electrical field
- Magnetic fields are generated by the spin of electrons or conduction of electricity
- Every cell in the body generates electricity and produces magnetic fields
- Chakras are electromagnetic fields, producing magnetic, electrical, and electromagnetic fields

### Level Three: Light and Sound

* Bodies emit light through ionizing radiation and biophotons
* Ions convey information in electrical charges and carry messages across bodily systems
* Ionization is the shifting of electrons from one atomic shell to another, creating positive or negative ions
* Negative ions form when an electron attaches to a neutral molecule, emitting a photon (light)
* Human body emits relatively high-intensity radiation and extremely low-intensity light radiation (biophotons)
* Biophotons are coherent, laser-like light emissions sensitive to environmental changes and help regulate reactions to the environment
* Biophoton field around a living being and even emanating from its DNA
* Light is malleable and can be converted into other forms of energy

**Sound**

* Vibrations that travel through a medium (air, water, solid)
* Frequency determines pitch, amplitude determines loudness
* Can interact with matter and cause physical effects (e.g., resonance, standing waves)

### THE SOUND OF AN APPLE FALLING

* Frequencies above 11 Hz create agitation, high-voltage power lines give off 50-60 Hz
* Extremely low-frequency (ELF) waves can shift consciousness downward and literally dumb people down.

### THE SOUND THAT CREATED LIFE ON EARTH

**Hindu Creation Stories and Sound**

- Emphasis on sound as the primal vibration creating life in the universe
- Om is considered the primal sound from which everything material manifested
- Each chakra resonates with its own specific tone or mantra
- Sounds are vital instruments in chakra medicine

**Scientific Perspective on Sound and Creation**

- Some scientists propose that sound, not light, was the first generative force behind creation
- **Cymatics**: scientific phenomenon where sound waves excite liquids and solids to create patterns and images
- Low frequency sounds, especially near hydrothermal vents, can hypothetically create "sonic scaffolding" for life

**Cymatics and Chakra Practices**

- Cymatics may explain the use of shapes or symbols in ancient and contemporary mystical and healing practices
- Broadband white noise penetrated water, filtering out high frequencies to leave low frequency sounds
- Low frequency sounds are mathematically imbued with the phi ratio and can create organized structures for life

**Discoveries Supporting Sound's Role in Creation**

- Discovery of pure tones in microscopic bubbles near hydrothermal vents in 1996
- Bubbles act as resonators that tune out all frequencies except those that resonate with them
- Low frequency sounds attract elements and create cymatic scaffolding necessary for life.

### LAWS OF CLASSICAL PHYSICS

- Substantiated by natural laws, despite being challenged by subtle energy
- **Newton's laws of motion and gravity**:
 * **Law of Gravity**: objects are attracted to each other or another mass
 * **Laws of Motion**:
    **First law**: objects resist changes in motion
    **Second law**: more force required for heavier objects
    **Third law**: every action has an equal and opposite reaction
- **Three laws of thermodynamics**:
 * **First law**: energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or changed form
 * **Second law**: entropy (disorder) increases in a closed system
 * **Third law**: entropy approaches a constant value as temperature approaches absolute zero
- **Einstein's contributions**:
 * **Theory of relativity**: laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers
  * Speed of light is constant in a vacuum, regardless of observer's motion
  * Massive objects distort space-time and create gravity
- **Classical physics limitations**:
  * Space and time are malleable
  * Time can shift
  * Subtle energy can change the past, future, and perceptions of the present
  * Space-time isn't consistent (ex. black holes creating gravitational waves)

### THE ORANGE UNIVERSE: QUANTA AND MORE

* **The Orange Universe**: understanding through quantum physics and chakra medicine

**Quantum Physics:**
- Singular term for plural "quanta" meaning discrete amount
- Subatomic particles with wave qualities, challenging immutable laws of reality
- Discrete units that can behave as both particles and waves
- **Two types of subatomic particles**: elementary and composite
 * **Elementary**: electrons, quarks, no substructure
 * **Composite**: protons, neutrons, have substructure
- Thirty-six confirmed fundamental particles, including antiparticles
  * Twelve carry forces (photon, gluon)
  * Twenty-four matter particles (neutrinos, quarks)
- New discoveries and information added regularly

**Laws of the Orange Universe:**

**Quantum Mechanics:**
- **Copenhagen Interpretation**: particle is only real when observed
- Particles can jump from one state to another (wave to particle and vice versa)
- Reality becomes "fixed" when observed, creating wave functions or ghosts
- **Uncertainty Principle**: cannot know both position and momentum at the same time
  * Operate with possibilities, not exactitudes
- **Spin rule**: all particles spin, but can't determine both speed and spin direction upon measurement
- Electron can be in multiple places or spinning in multiple directions at once, observation selects placement

**Entanglement:**
- Two or more objects interrelate, affecting each other even when separated by great distances or dimensions.

* **Personal level**: once we make a decision, another part of us continues in the nonselected reality
* Reality can be accessed by shifting perception through biofield or matrix

**Pilot Wave Theory and Supersonic Nature of Energy**

* Pilot wave theory suggests a pilot wave accompanies all physical waves
* Superluminal (faster than the speed of light)
* Determines where a particle or photon will appear
* Reality is nonlocal and interconnected at all levels
* Consciousness can shift the pilot wave
* Quantum entanglement supports this theory 
* **Caveat**: subtle energy must move faster than the speed of light
* Some studies suggest energy can move faster than the speed of light

### THE VIRTUAL NATURE OF THE VACUUM AND THE ROLE OF CONSCIOUSNESS

* The vacuum is not empty, but filled with virtual particles (paired electron-positron or quark-antiquark)
* Virtual particles are ephemeral and exist for a short time
* Vacuum fluctuations lead to the question of whether matter is made of vacuum fluctuations 
* **Energy from virtual particles can become material particles through various mechanisms**: Higgs field or zero-point energy
* The Higgs field creates mass out of quantum vacuum in the form of virtual Higgs bosons
* Zero-point energy carries infinite possibilities and assumes form when manifested
* Subtle energy, including zero-point energy, can be at least partially directed by human consciousness
* Consciousness is linked to perspective, subjective in nature
* Thousands of studies document the effects of consciousness on physical reality
* Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory (PEAR Lab) research shows that mind can alter objects, people, and events despite time and space separation.

### MY PERSONAL “MANY SPEEDS THEORY” IN RELATION TO CHAKRAS
**Personal "Many Speeds Theory" in Relation to Chakras**

- Subtle energies move faster than the speed of light, while physical energies travel slower
- Chakras link consciousness to process and communicate various speeds of energy
- Lijun Wang's experiment at NEC Research Institute disproved Einstein's theory about matter moving faster than the speed of light in a vacuum
- Quantum logic explains that massless energy can't gain more mass as it "speeds up" and quantum entanglement proves timeless connection between energies
- Consciousness selects blueprints from nonphysical fields, which appear in physical reality, making subtle energy faster than the speed of light
- Chakras act as libraries containing blueprints for manifestation; Dr. Amit Goswami calls original blueprints morphogenetic field
- Chakras contain and connect with all planes of reality, including causal energy, which exists before conception and serves as a template for the subtle body system
- Reality and energy graduate from lowest to highest order within each chakra and in relation to the body

**Gross Level (Slow-moving Energy)**

- Associated with physical organs and activities
- Affects health of nerve plexus, endocrine gland, bodily area, thoughts, and feelings

**Subtle Level (Faster-than-the-speed-of-light Energy)**

- Interacts with psychic energies
- Spins what doesn't exist into existence and vice versa
- Highly interactive, operating through fields, channels, and energy centers
- Links us with everything and everyone in the universe

**Causal Level (Faster-than-the-speed-of-light Energy)**

- Reaches toward higher spiritual principles
- Elevates gross and subtle experiences to a more spiritual state

* **Torsion fields**: new force discovered by Nikolay Kozyrev, created by mass and spinning particles 
* **Torsion waves**: particle radiation resulting from sudden spin changes
* Direction of twist predicts entropy increase or decrease at origin
* Information disappears from one place and appears elsewhere due to torsion fields
* Torsion fields create patterns and encode information
* Subtle energy work uses shapes to produce change
* Particle shifts can create torsion fields, but patterns can also invoke shifts
* Physicists exploring idea that energies respond to bundles of properties (color, shape)
* One thought or feeling (or color or shape) could spin a new reality
* Average person can use this knowledge to make a difference by organizing energy towards desired reality.

### PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER: A BRAVE NEW MODEL

**Unified Theory of Energy (Scroggins' Theories)**

- Dr. C. Michael Scroggins presented a theory connecting classical and quantum physics, focusing on subtle energy
- All molecules share a common radial size with energy and mass
- Radial size is the square of any item's p r (frequency)
- Matter is always an exact size and rides inside an exact frequency
- Frequency determines what appears in physical reality
- Universe began as compressed frequencies, matter formed from combining masses
- Reality becomes concrete when traveling frequencies "match" molecules
- Energy travels across and through frequencies
- Humans are a large compilation of varying structural masses bound by critical mass overlaps
- **Observer theory**: Perception is based on frequency activation
- **Dimensional phasing**: Objects can change appearance or properties based on activated frequencies

**Applications of Scroggins' Theories**

- Transform chakra and allopathic medicine
- Transportation
- Nutrition

**Molecules and Frequencies**

- All molecules share a common radial size with energy and mass
- Radial size is the square of any item's p r (frequency)
- Matter is always an exact size, riding inside an exact frequency
- Frequency determines what appears in physical reality

**Creation of the Universe**

- Universe began as compressed frequencies
- Matter formed from combining masses with similar properties
- Reality becomes concrete when traveling frequencies "match" molecules

**Frequencies and Perception**

- **Observer theory**: Perception is based on frequency activation
- **Dimensional phasing**: Objects can change appearance or properties based on activated frequencies

**Energy and Frequencies**

- Energy travels across and through frequencies
- Humans are a large compilation of varying structural masses bound by critical mass overlaps
- All matter in the universe interrelates, creating a "butterfly effect"

### Things in the physical universe don’t change as often as would be implied

* The physical universe doesn't change often due to everything being coded
* Molecules are just the surface of a vast ocean of movement
* Distorted codes create gaps where subtle energy tries to fill in
* Subtle energy interacts with frequencies to create material change
* Our bodies have frequency set points for various systems
* Frequency variations activate indicators at chromosomal and molecular levels
* Intention activates like-matter frequencies across the universe
* Gaps are open areas where frequency exists but no molecules are being vibrated into being
* Gaps allow interaction, creation, and love
* Subtle energy works to fill in gaps and rebalance systems
* Chakras and other energetic organs are interfaces for reading frequencies and activating physical reactions
* Dr. Scroggins' research enables assessment of imbalances and determination of solutions based on molecular patterns and frequencies.

**Important Concepts:**
- Coding in the physical universe
- Molecular structures and vibrations
- Distorted codes and gaps
- Subtle energy and frequency interaction
- Frequency set points and variations
- Intention and like-matter activation
- Gaps as points of interaction
- Chakras and energetic organs.

### THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL MODEL: SUBTLE LEVELS BETWEEN THE PHYSICAL AND HEAVENLY

- More layers of reality exist beyond physical and subtle ones
- Subtle energy is immeasurable and contains all other nonmeasurable energy
- Dozens of subtle energy experts and spiritual systems have postulated sublayers of invisible reality

**Important Ideas About Subtle Levels of Energy**

- We are multidimensional beings composed of a spectrum of energetic frequencies
- Concepts apply to all living beings, earth, objects in the cosmos, and the multiverse

**Historical Development of Subtle Reality Concepts**

*Koshas (Ancient Hindu Practices)*: Five sheaths of reality from most physical to most supreme: physical, energy, mental, wisdom, and bliss.

*Ancient Systems* (Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, Hebrews): Structured model composed of energetic and spiritual bodies.

*Modern Systems* (Freemasons, Theosophists, Neo-Theosophists, Rudolf Steiner, Barbara Ann Brennan): Key chakra medicine concepts such as energetic anatomy, sacred geometry, and subtle levels of reality.

**Subtle Reality Levels Over Time**

*Paracelsus*: Material body made from earth elements and a sidereal body that accesses an illuminating light.

*Manly Hall*: Five bodies: physical, etheric and vital, emotional, vehicles of the concrete, and intuitive sheath.

*H.P. Blavatsky*: Seven planes of reality from densest to highest, four linked to cosmic consciousness.

*Max Heindel*: Seven worlds revealing chakras as seven red roses.

*Alice Bailey*: Planes as physical, emotional (astral), mental, intuitional, spiritual, monadic, and divine.

*Charles Leadbeater*: Seven planes of existence and related energetic bodies.

*Rudolf Steiner*: Several sheaths of energy interpenetrating the human body.

**Next Chapters**: More information about these levels of subtle reality.

### DID EARLIER PEOPLES HARNESS SUBTLE ENERGY?

- Many beliefs suggest that ancient knowledge of energy is being rediscovered
- Hindus had advanced understanding of science and physics

**Hindu Beliefs and Modern Physics**
 
* **Five elements**: space, light/fire, earth, water, air
* Subtle bodies composed of abstract qualities in non-physical space (chittakash)
* Cyclical universe with segments of time (kalpas)
* Multiple worlds and dimensions

**Similarities between Hinduism and Modern Science**

* Ancient Hindus mapped planets, observed spherical earth, proposed gravitational force
* Sumerians, Babylonians, Tahitians, Mayans had similar ideas of universal energy
* Hindus and Mayans shared cyclical universe theories
* Hindu cosmology includes fourteen parallel realities and multiple dimensions
* Advanced technologies described in ancient texts (airplanes, explosives)

**Vedic Understanding of Atoms and Consciousness**

* Kanada, originator of Indian Nyaya-Vaisheshika school, taught atom theory and vacuum 
* **Consciousness permeated the Vedic world**: subject cannot be aware of object without relation
* Universe is an expansion of the mind, put in our minds by God

**Possible Early Understanding of Modern Physics**

* Signs suggest even earlier culture may have laid groundwork for modern physics.

### WAS ATLANTIS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY KNOWLEDGE?

* Atlantis was an advanced civilization mentioned in myths and legends, described as harnessing energy (Plato, Edgar Cayce)
* Existed around 50,000 BCE, with early beings having no solid bodies but made of pure white energy 
* **Two groups evolved**: Law of One (enlightenment) and Sons of Belial (darkness and cruelty)
* Atlanteans used advanced technology, including a death ray, explosives, radioactive forces, and atomic energy
* First disaster caused continents to split; second disaster from misuse of a giant crystal
* Atlanteans could travel in elements, rejuvenate bodies, perform astral travel, and use crystals for energy
* Understanding of energy, physical or subtle, mirrored in various cultures (Hopi, Native American, Asian)
* Energy is information that moves; apple physics vs. orange physics 
 * **Apple physics**: controlled by rules like the three laws of thermodynamics 
 * **Orange physics**: reality is malleable, time and space are not fixed
* Chakras explained through various theories, including units of light, sound, fields, frequency, Many Worlds Theory, Connective Tissue Theory
* Energy is both physical and subtle, real and powerful, described our soul.

## 20. CHAKRAS AS PART OF THE SUBTLE ENERGY ANATOMY
**Chakras as Part of Subtle Energy Anatomy**

- Dr. Scroggins' email in November 2013 discussed the unity of snowflakes and dimensions.
- Chakras are unique energy centers, but part of a larger system.
- Three categories of subtle energy structures:
  - **Energy channels:**
    - Like rivers transporting subtle energy.
    - Connect energy bodies with energy fields.
    - Picture subtle energy as ships in channels.
  - **Energy fields:**
    - Vibrational sheaths surrounding living beings.
    - Protect, filter, and invite communication.
    - Human energy field paired with a chakra.
  - **Energy bodies:**
    - Chakras are part of this category.

**Meet the Family of Subtle Energy Structures**

- Chakras are individuated vortexes of energy.
- Part of a larger system: energy channels, fields, and bodies.
- Energy channels manage and direct subtle energy distribution.
- Energy fields surround living beings and serve multiple functions.
- Energy bodies include chakras.
- Many versions of these systems exist."

### THE SUBTLE CHANNELS

**Subtle Channels:**

- **Two types**: meridians (Eastern) and nadis (Indian philosophy)
- Both involve chakras

**Nadis:**

- Streams of energy, measurable and immeasurable
- **Gross nadis**: channels of subtle energy related to meridians, nerves, cardiovascular and lymph vessels
  - **Three main nadis**: sushumna, ida, pingala
- **Subtle nadis**: channels of mind or feeling self
  - **Pranavaha nadis**: carry prana (vital force)
  - **Manavaha nadis**: carry mental shakti (forces)
- Anchored in the body but considered pranic in nature
- Nourish the chakras and physical body

**Three Fundamental Nadis:**

- **Central nadi (sushumna)**: multilayered, located within the spine, bright red, associated with tamas guna, manifests parasympathetic nervous system, only activated during specific breathing patterns and at dawn/dusk, linked to Sarasvati River
- **Ida**: continuation of vajrini nadi, pale-moon colored, feminine, situated on left side of spine, terminates in left nostril, stimulates right side of brain, governs emotions, intelligence, related to tamas guna, considered core to left sympathetic nervous system, symbolized by left eye and hand, linked to Ganges River
- **Pingala**: masculine, situated at right side of spine, ends at right nostril, stimulates left side of brain, golden-red in color, contains deadly poison (visam), governs vitality, prana, temperament, action, willpower, artistry, linked to rajas guna, dominant during right nostril breathing, related to Yamuna River.

### ELEVEN SUPPORTIVE NADIS
**Eleven Supportive Nadis**

- **Sushumna, Ida, and Pingala** are the primary nadis, with eleven other nadis supporting a fully functioning energetic system.

**Left Channel (Ida, Gandhari, Hastajihva)**

- **Ida**: Stretches from the base of the spine to the left nostril.
- **Gandhari**: Runs alongside ida from the corner of the left eye to the left big toe. Supports ida.
- **Hastajihva**: From below the right eye to the big toe of the left foot. Complements ida.

**Right Channel (Pingala, Yashasvini, Pusha)**

- **Pingala**: Stretches from the base of the spine to the right nostril.
- **Yashasvini**: From the right big toe to the left ear. Complements pingala.
- **Pusha**: From the left big toe to the right ear. Supports pingala.

**Other Nadis**

- **Alambusha**: Starts at the anus and ends at the mouth.
- **Kuhu**: Originates in the throat and terminates at the genitals. Helps chitrini nadi cause ejaculation in men.
- **Shankhini**: Starts in the throat, between sarasvati and gandhari, ending in the anus.
- **Sarasvati**: Starts in the kanda (base of the spine) and ends in the tongue. Enables all that is said to come true. Complementary channel to sushumna.
- **Payasvini**: Flows between pusha and sarasvati, terminates in the right ear. Activated by pure metal earrings.
- **Varuni**: Between yashasvini and kuhu, ends at the anus. Purifies toxins in lower trunk of body.
- **Vishvodara**: Flows between kuhu and hastajihva, resides in the naval. Involved with digestive processes, adrenal glands, and pancreas. Distributes prana throughout the body.

**Ten Gates (Orifices) and Nadis**

- Associated nadis and gates: 
  - sushumna - fontanel (tenth gate)
  - ida - left nostril (ninth gate)
  - pingala - right nostril (eighth gate)
  - gandhari - left eye (seventh gate)
  - hastajihva - right eye (sixth gate)
  - yashasvini - left ear (fifth gate)
  - pusha - right ear (fourth gate)
  - alambusha - mouth (third gate)
  - kuhu - genitals (second gate)
  - shankhini - anus (first gate).
- At death, the soul or vital force exits from one of these ten gates.

**Opening Up the Sushumna**

- Inside sushumna:
  - **Vajrini or vajra nadi**: Gold-colored, linked to rajas guna, starts at sixth chakra and ends at gonads. Masculine energy works outside through pingala and inside as vajrini. Contains flowing nectar, sometimes believed poisonous.
  - **Chitrini or chitra nadi**: Silver-white, linked to sattva guna, starts in bindu chakra and ends in svayambhu lingam in first chakra. Illuminating, serves as channel for kundalini. Responsible for dreams, hallucinations, and visions. Conveyer of moon or feminine energy inside sushumna.
  - **Brahma nadi**: Entered through Brahma dvara (door of Brahma), leads directly to brahmarandhra. Hollow passage for the rise of kundalini energy. Not always thought of as a separate nadi but rather as a passage.

### CHAKRAS AND THE NADIS

**Chakras and Nadis**

- Chakras and nadis are interconnected, with nadis serving the chakras during a kundalini rising
- **Three most important nadis**: sushumna, ida, pingala
- Kundalini rises through these nadis after activation in the first chakra
- Ida and pingala cross five times, stimulating chakras and forming mukta triveni
- Kundalini continues into the crown chakra after passing through sushumna
- Other pathways for kundalini include vajra and sarasvati nadis

**Ida and Pingala in Everyday Life**

- Ida and pingala symbolize feminine and masculine nature
- Access assets of ida and pingala through respiration
- Most people breathe out through one nostril, accessing either right (creative/intuitive) or left (active/logical) brain hemisphere
- Every four hours, switch nostrils to access different brain abilities
- Ida originates in the kanda, linked with left testicle (males) and ovary (females), associated with relaxation and meditation
- Pingala initiates in the same chakra organ, connected to right testicle (males) and ovary (females), stimulates physical strength and virility
- Force change in breath between nostrils for different brain hemisphere access or to balance needs
- Most yogic breathing exercises encourage left nostril dominance for meditative state and intuitive openness
- Esoterics recommend pingala stimulation for physical strength, speed, and nighttime energy
- Close off ida when experiencing lethargy, self-pity, or extreme emotions; close off pingala when dealing with hyperactivity or fanaticism
- Breathe through both nostrils to activate sushumna and invite awareness of the present moment

### SUBTLE CHANNELS: THE MERIDIANS
 
* **Meridians**: energy channels described in traditional Chinese medicine for over 5,000 years
* Part of Eastern and Western medical systems
* Form a circulatory system carrying subtle energy (chi or ki) around the body
* Connect hundreds of acupuncture points (acupoints) on the skin 
* **Twelve major meridians**: Liver, Heart, Spleen, Lung, Kidney, Pericardium, Gallbladder, Stomach, Small Intestine, Urinary Bladder, Large Intestine, Triple Warmer
* Each meridian is yin or yang and connects to specific organs and body systems
* Meridians become imbalanced when congested or not receiving required sustenance, leading to health issues and emotional difficulties

**Liver Meridian:** power plant of the body

**Heart Meridian:** development of personality within cosmic order

**Spleen Meridian:** distributes energy for tasks

**Lung Meridian:** connects to rhythms of the surrounding world

**Kidney Meridian:** contains physical and spiritual inheritance

**Pericardium Meridian:** collection and release of joy

**Gallbladder Meridian:** enables decision making

**Small Intestine Meridian:** absorbs and transforms energies within the body

**Stomach Meridian:** processes energies received in the body

**Large Intestine Meridian:** transmits energies and releases wastes

**Urinary Bladder Meridian:** keeps body’s energy in motion

**Triple Warmer (or Burner) Meridian:** creates and dissolves energies; responsible for overall vitality
 
* **Two additional meridians**: Conception Vessel (yin) and Governor Vessel (yang) 
* **Research substantiating the existence of meridians**:
  + Tubular structures containing liquids, DNA granules, and adult stem cells (Kim Bonghan)
  + Light enters and exits body at acupuncture points along meridians (Russian researchers)
  + Meridians act as optical fibers transferring light throughout the body
  + Injection of radioactive isotopes into acupoints shows movement along meridians (French scientists)
* Needle insertion disrupts C fibers and Merkel cells, sending sensory information electrically (recent research)
* Possible link between nadis (Indian system) and meridians (some researchers believe so)

### SUBTLE CHANNELS: PARALLELS BETWEEN NADIS AND MERIDIANS

* Nadis and meridians may be the same according to some experts
* Correspondences between chakra system and meridian-based theories in Traditional Chinese Medicine
* Life force is carried through complex networks of pathways, designated as masculine (yang) or feminine (yin)
* Problems result from disturbances of energy flow 
* **Hiroshi Motoyama's assessment**:
  * Discredits traditional link between nadis and nervous system
  * Identifies many nadis with meridians, chakras with acupuncture points
  * Ida and pingala originate at first chakra and end at nostrils, not sympathetic nervous trunks
  * Sushumna identified with Governor Vessel meridian
  * Shoshuten practice raises energy from coccyx to top of head, same as raising kundalini 
* **Meridians and Chakras linkages**:
 * **Second chakra**: Conception vessel points associated with yin energy and kidney reserves in the second chakra region
 * **Third chakra**: Conception vessel points related to willpower, assertiveness, and digestive organs within the third chakra region
 * **Fourth chakra**: Conception vessel point on breastbone supports lungs and heart, similar to heart chakra
 * **Seventh chakra**: Energy enters crown through Governor Vessel 20 (Bai Hui) and seventh chakra (sahasrara) in the same area.

### THE ENERGETIC FIELDS

**Energetic Fields:**

- **Hundreds of measurable and immeasurable fields affect living organisms**, including:
  - morphological fields
  - geofields
  - universal light field
  - L-fields
  - T-fields
  - electrical
  - magnetic
  - electromagnetic
  - sound fields
- Human body generates various electrical, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields that interact with chakras and the auric field
- Auric fields exist around all living beings and can be visualized as seven layers in rainbow color progression, each related to a chakra
- Auric fields provide protection, filter information, and emit psychic messages
- Seven rays are forces or types of energy that intersect with or enter the chakras and influence our energetic bodies

**Auric Fields:**

- Exist around all living organisms, including humans
- Can be detected through Kirlian photography and other methods
- Associated with the chakras, each auric field operating on the same frequency band as its corresponding chakra
- **Seven layers, each delivering specific functions**: 
  - protection
  - screening emotions
  - filtering ideas
  - attracting/repelling relationships
  - receiving choices
  - visualizing decisions
  - connecting with spirits

**Seven Rays:**

- Rooted in various cultures and traditions, including India, Gnosticism, Mithraic mysteries, and Theosophical Society
- Each ray represents a certain quality or state of consciousness that interacts with the chakras and influences our energetic bodies
- Seven major rays are emanations of the Divine and governed by higher beings
- **Ray qualities**: 
  - Will or power (Red)
  - Love-wisdom (Blue)
  - Active intelligence (Yellow)
  - Harmony (Green)
  - Concrete knowledge (Orange)
  - Devotion or Idealism (Indigo)
  - Ceremonial magic (Violet)

**Zachary Landsdowne's Analysis of Theosophical Beliefs and Rig Veda:**

* Seven popular concepts in Rig Veda: seven mares or streams of consciousness, rays of the sun or beings, sisters, rivers, etc.
* Conclusion: many Theosophical beliefs mirror those in the Rig Veda
* Seven rays reflect these attributes:
  * Divine qualities "stepped down" to purify human beings
  * Sequences of ideas assisting mental well-being
  * Affect us on three different planes or worlds
  * Divide humanity into seven communities, each with an invisible guide

**Robert Ghost Wolf's Teachings:**

* Seven rays of rainbows influence consciousness and spin the dream called life
* At end times (fifth world), seven rays will be multiplied into twelve rays
* Each ray relates to a chakra:
  * **First Leadership (Red)** - holds vibration of earth
  * **Second Understanding and knowledge (Sky blue)** - unites knowledge of Father and wisdom of earth
  * **Third Healing (Green)** - vibrates all memories
  * **Fourth Sun radiation (Yellow)** - stimulates growth
  * **Fifth Scientific understanding (Cobalt blue)** - embraces order and cycles
  * **Sixth Devotion (Rose)** - invites oneness
  * **Seventh Transition (Violet)** - enables transformation

### ENERGY BODIES IN ADDITION TO THE CHAKRAS

**Energy Bodies Beyond Chakras**

- Chakras are not the only energy bodies; they interact with other types of energy bodies and realms of reality.
- Energy bodies serve multiple functions: as an energetic field, level of reality, and interface with physical chakras.
- These energy bodies surround the physical body and are linked to various spatial dimensions or layers of consciousness.

**Energy Bodies and Their Functions**

*Each energy body performs three key roles:*

1. **Functions as an energetic field:** Interacts with the physical body and other energetic systems (nadis, meridians, chakras).
2. **Operates as a level of reality:** Each layer instructs the one beneath it, enabling us to reach higher states of consciousness.
3. **Interfaces with body-based chakras:** Often through chakras specific to each energy body.

**Basic Energy Bodies and Their Characteristics**

*The following are some common energy bodies:*

**Etheric Body:**

- Operates outside the physical body.
- Interrelates with it and all energetic systems.
- Frequently affiliated with two auric layers and three spatial dimensions.
- Responds to the physical body and programs it.
- Has seven energy centers, twenty-one minor energy centers, and several smaller ones.

**Emotional Body:**

- Also called the astral body.
- Relates to emotional or astral planes.
- Runs individual's desires, imagination, and psychic abilities.
- Linked with four spatial dimensions.
- Organized into seven energy centers, twenty-one minor energy centers, and several smaller ones.

**Mental Body:**

- Also called the intellectual body.
- Facilitates thinking, intelligence, and discernment.
- Covers five spatial dimensions.
- Includes seven major energy centers, twenty-one minor energy centers, and several small ones.
- Has several layers extending from individual thoughts to abstract truths.

**Causal Body:**

- Also called the soul body.
- Originates our true personality.
- Absorbs essence back into itself after death.
- Exists for millions of years and individuates as the soul.
- Occupies five spatial dimensions.
- Looks like a flower with twelve petals.

**Buddhic Body:**

- Also called the intuitional body.
- Enables us to transcend mind functions.
- Comprehends essence of thoughts rather than just thoughts themselves.
- Gains related state of consciousness once significant spiritual progress is made.
- Has its own five senses and six spatial dimensions.
- Is elastic in nature, expanding for interdimensional travel.

*Additional energy bodies include the atmic body (seven spatial dimensions) and monadic body (nine spatial dimensions).*

### HOW THE ETHERIC BODY OPERATES

**Etheric Body and Its Interrelation with Other Energy Bodies**

* The etheric body interacts with other energy bodies, each layer having higher frequencies and sustaining the one beneath it
* Serves as interface between physical body and subtle forces
* Powers the body and links it to the world through chakras, meridians, nadis, and auric layers
* Holographic in nature, with interference patterns around the body mirroring its structure
* Etheric field discovered to be holographic by Dr. Marina Shaduri and Dr. George Tshitshinadze using gas discharge visualization (GDV) photography
* Hologram serves as a blueprint for the physical body, with illnesses potentially preexisting in the etheric body
* Subtle bodies may instruct the physical body, as shown by research on meridians and the developing embryo

**Subtle Bodies Instructing the Physical Body**

* Meridians develop before other systems in a fetus and might determine cell specialization
* Fertilized egg consolidates into a primary cell, which merges biological and spiritual functions
* Epigenetic damage in the primary cell can cause traumas or illnesses later in life, influenced by ancestral memories and occurrences
* Meridians are primary cell microtubules that attach to both the cell membrane and chakras at the embryonic level
* Chakras exist but are not fully understood in connection to the triune brain 
* **McFetridge's understanding of in-utero chakric development**: different chakra configurations for egg and sperm, mature chakra system fuses into a single disk-like shape in solar plexus area.

### ENERGY BODIES: THE LIGHT BODY
 
* **Light Body** or **"Body of Light"**: a subtle energy system believed to be a layer of the aura and an entire system operating at a soul level 
* **Function**: enables holding more light or energy for higher consciousness 
* **Historical background**:
  + Pythagoreans wrote about the "Luminous Light Body" in pre-Christian times
  + Greek Neoplatonist philosopher Proclus discussed a luminous body mediating between soul and body
  + Gnostic literature mentions it in the first century
  + Found in Chinese, Indian, Mongolian, and Tibetan literature 
* **Esoteric proponents**: Aleister Crowley described the human journey as creating a subtle body called the Body of Light 
* **Three levels of light body**:
  + Spirit-body: aligned with physical body, similar to the nephesch or vegetative-animal soul in Kabbalah
  + Radiant body: allows experiencing higher states while still physical, leading to resurrection body
* Achievement involves purification rituals using altars, symbols, and ceremony
* Modern systems describe light body as composed of chakras, interdimensional column of light, and Merkabah
* Light body linked to astral body but larger and located around and above it
* Astral body matures and blocks the light body due to past life issues and ego
* Chakras operate as gateways to the light body, spinning freely between lifetimes but becoming blocked in physical bodies
* Higher Self can access lower self through chakras and direct consciousness towards higher things
* Eventually, chakras become drawn into astral body and incarnate through etheric body
* New chakras may develop as the light body becomes more active.

### ENERGY BODIES: THE DANTIANS

**Energy Bodies: The Dantians**

- Three-part energetic structure also known as elixir fields, seas of chi, or energy centers
- Located in Eastern traditions, similar to chakras and hara
  - **Lower dantian**: located in lower abdomen, center of gravity, associated with sexuality
  - **Middle dantian**: level with heart, stores chi, regulates respiration and internal organs
  - **Upper dantian**: between eyebrows, holds shen (energy of consciousness), relates to the brain
- Important energy centers in Qigong literature
- Taoist energetic storage centers, while chakras store energy for nadis and act as intake/export valves
- Microcosmic orbit practice circulates energy through both dantians and chakras
- Similar procedures in kundalini-based modalities and Eastern approaches, such as t'ai chi

**Subtle Energy Anatomy Snapshot**

- **According to Dr. Motoyama**: three energetic bodies each with its own mind
  - **Physical body** and physical mind (controls body consciousness)
  - Astral or **subtle body** and its mind (controls emotions and feelings)
  - **Causal body** and its mind (expressed through intelligence)
- Each body-mind holds energy centers and channels that manage the flow of prana
- Chakras are control centers that run the exchange between dimensions and interact with physical body via nadis/meridians
- **Bodies in the physical realm**: cardiovascular, lymphatic, meridian systems
- **Channels**: nadis (same as meridians)
- **Centers**: brain, nervous plexuses, acupuncture points
- Each chakra is a control center that runs the exchange between dimensions and koshas (sheaths of consciousness)
- Interacts with physical body via nadis
- Additional energetic structures include seven rays, dantians, and other cultures' energy bodies
- All major energetic structures present at conception, assisting in the design of the body.

## 21. THE SCIENCE AND STRUCTURE OF CHAKRAS

**Chakras**

- Each chakra is a unique energy body with its own relationship to physical and subtle energy.
- **Depicted as a column of energy bodies nourished by three interweaving energy channels**: ida, pingala, and sushumna.
- Chakras represent nerve plexuses and specific vertebrae in the central nervous system.
- Associated with various organs and endocrine glands.
- Psychologically influential gateways to consciousness.

**Chakras as Psychophysiological Organs**

- Depicted as a column of energy bodies in the yogic chakra system.
- Each chakra represents a nerve plexus and specific vertebrae.
- Interact with nerves linked to various organs, including endocrine glands.
- Popularized through the work of John Woodroffe and Charles Leadbeater.
- Enhanced understanding through scientific knowledge about the neurological system, brain, and endocrine glands.

**Nervous System**

- Composed of nerve tissue that transmits electrical and chemical messages to run all aspects of the body.
- **Central nervous system**: spinal cord and brain.
 * **Spine**: twenty-six bones including sacrum, coccyx, and twenty-four vertebrae.
  * Each part associated with a nerve plexus.
- **Brain**: three main parts.
 * **Brain stem**: connects brain to spinal cord, controls basic life activities.
 * **Cerebellum**: manages muscle coordination, balance, and voluntary movements.
 * **Cerebral cortex**: deals with thinking and higher awareness, divided into two hemispheres.
- **Peripheral nervous system**: nerves outside of the central nervous system.
  * Sensory-based part receives stimuli.
  * Motor-based part initiates response.
  * Somatic nervous system manages functions under conscious control.
  * Autonomic nervous system governs involuntary functions.
    + Sympathetic: prepares body for activity, stress, and emergencies.
    + Parasympathetic: lowers activity and allows digestion and conservation of energy.
- Primary constituent of the nervous system is the neuron or nerve cell.
  * Passes information through electrical charges called impulses.
  * Grouped in circuits to convey information efficiently.
  * Neurological deliveries are electricity conveyed along cell membranes via ions.
- The brain triggers six trillion electrical signals through neurons every second.

### THE CHEMICAL SIGNALS OF LIFE: NEUROTRANSMITTERS

**Neurotransmitters:** small molecules carrying chemical signals between cells for communication

- Outnumber stars in Milky Way, carry various messages (e.g., pain, hunger, emotions)
- Reach destination through receptor sites on neural and bodily cells
- Over 100 types in brain alone; excitatory, inhibitory, or both stimulate/inhibit neurons
- Produced inside nerve through electrical process using ions
- **Excitatory**: epinephrine, norephenylamine
- **Inhibitory**: serotonin, GABA
- **Both stimulatory and inhibitory**: acetylcholine, dopamine

**Neurotransmitter Functions:**

- Regulate heartbeat, breathing, movement, mood, learning, weight, sleep
- Neuropeptides run emotions; monoamines react to stress
- Imbalances linked to disorders (addictions, obesity, depression, etc.)

**Types of Neurotransmitters:**

- **Acetylcholine**: integral to attention and arousal in CNS and PNS, activates muscles

- **Amino Acids**:
  - **GABA**: blocks neurological transmissions, relieves pain and anxiety
  - **Glutamate**: involved in cognition, memory, learning
  - **Aspartate**: similar to glutamate
  - **Glycine**: enables movement, vision, hearing

- **Neuropeptides**:
  - **Oxytocin**: increases sexual arousal, bonding, trust
  - **Endorphins**: reduces perception of pain, increases euphoria, modulates appetite, releases sex hormones, enhances immune system
  - **Vasopressin**: facilitates learning and memory

- **Monoamines**:
  - **Epinephrine (adrenaline)**: activates stress reaction
  - **Norepinephrine**: triggers reactions to stress
  - **Histamine**: triggers inflammatory response
  - **Dopamine**: secreted when something good happens, linked with addiction
  - **Serotonin**: reduces appetite and sexual behavior, suppresses pain perception (80% produced in the gut)

- **Purines**:
  - **Adenosine**: suppresses arousal, promotes sleep, performs important activities in different parts of the body
  - Part of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy to cells

- **Lipids and Gases**:
  - **Nitric oxide**: reduces inflammation, increases endurance, activates senses, assists immune system, improves memory
  - **Cannabinoids**: activate same receptors as marijuana, initially creating relaxation before decreasing concentration and increasing paranoia.

### THE “SECOND BRAIN”

**The Enteric Nervous System (Second Brain)**

- Located between anus and esophagus
- Contains 100 million neurons, more than head brain and peripheral nervous system combined
- Made of neural tissue filled with neurotransmitters and neuropeptides
- Influences mental and physical health
- Communicates with head brain through vagus nerve
- Determines 80% of immunity and emotional health
- Operates autonomously from central nervous system

**Properties of the Second Brain**

- Contains neurotransmitters and neuropeptides
- Neurotransmitters respond to stimuli in brain and second brain
- Neuropeptide synthesis occurs in enteric nerves and gut-associated lymph system
- 95% of serotonin, a dual-operating neurotransmitter and hormone, lies in the bowels
- Important for various diseases, including irritable bowel syndrome, osteoporosis, and mental illnesses

**Neuropeptides**

- Part of larger group of chemical signals called peptide hormones
- Send and relay information to neighboring cells, creating electrical activity
- Bind to cell surface, more powerful than other neurotransmitters
- Found in both head brain and second brain
- Operate throughout body, proving mind is not only located in the brain but also spread throughout body

**Discoveries of Dr. Candace Pert**

- Cellular receptors for emotions and states of mind found on every cell in the body
- Vibrating cellular receptors create and join electrical vibrations (EMF or frequencies)
- Cells send and receive vibrations, establishing empathy and even ESP.

### CHAKRAS AND OUR NEUROLOGY: THE SCIENTIFIC PICTURE

- Chakras discovered to be linked to nerve bundles and peptides processing emotions
- Revealed as mini brains with electrical and chemical activity
- Related to nerve plexus, vertebrae areas, and left/right brain hemispheres

**Chakra-Brain Correlation**
 
* **Right brain**: Intuitive, creative, controls left side of body (ida nadi, yin) 
* **Left brain**: Logical, action-oriented, manages right side of body (pingala nadi, yang)
* Chakras linked to network of cells affected by neuropeptides and neurotransmitters

**Chakra Functions and Second Brain**
 
* **First chakra (genital/hip area)**: Primal concerns, "flight, fight, or freeze" reactions 
* **Second chakra (abdomen)**: Center of feelings, governs intestines 
* **Third chakra (solar plexus)**: Processes thoughts, manages remaining digestive organs
* Lower three chakras operate as a unit, top chakras as a unit, heart mitigates between

**Chakras and Brain Regions**

- **Brainstem**: First chakra
- **Cerebellum**: Second chakra
- **Parietal, occipital, temporal lobes**: Third chakra
- **Thalamus region (hypothalamus)**: Fourth chakra
- **Broca's area**: Fifth chakra
- **Frontal brain (minus prefrontal cortex)**: Sixth chakra
- **Prefrontal cortex**: Seventh chakra

**Chakras and Endocrine System**

- Interdependent systems using chemical signals for communication
- Nervous system controls endocrine glands, hormones produced by other glands
- Hormones act on target cells throughout the body via circulatory system
- Hormones can be water or lipid soluble, regulated by hypothalamus and nutrition.

### chakras are hormonal 

* Chakras have a relationship with both the neurological and endocrine systems

**Chakra-Endocrine System Connection:**
- Serena Roney-Dougal, a parapsychologist, believes the main aspect of the chakric system is the endocrine system
- **She connects specific chakras to particular endocrine glands**: pineal (6th & 7th), pituitary (7th), gonads (1st & 2nd), adrenals (3rd), breasts (4th), thyroid (5th)
- Hormonal activity explains rare chakric functions

**Pineal Gland:**
- Connected to the sixth and seventh chakras by Roney-Dougal
- Produces hormones like melatonin, serotonin, MAO inhibitors, and pinoline
 * **Melatonin**: regulates activity at other traditional chakra sites, improves gland function, increases longevity
 * **Pinoline**: stimulates psi experiences during sleep

**Other Theories:**
- **Dr. Earlynne Cheney**: glands are physical counterparts to the chakras
- **Adelaide Gardner**: chakras influence the glands
- **Alice Bailey**: glands interconnect the chakras and dense physical body

* Chakras interact with both the neurological and endocrine systems, benefiting their effectiveness
- Nervous system enables quick responses, endocrine system allows consistent change

### CHAKRAS AND FIELDS AND FREQUENCIES

**Chakras and Fields and Frequencies**

- Chakras are multidimensional energy centers, not just nodes and glands
- Human body generates various fields of energy, including electromagnetic fields (EMF) and harmonic frequencies
- Every part of the body transmits energy, which can be perceived as fields and frequencies
- Biological activities, emotions, thoughts also generate fields and frequencies
- Frequencies have specific formulas and energies connected to them
- Vibrating the correct frequency can create a response without energy exchange or transfer
- Resonance occurs when frequencies match, causing amplification of vibrations
- Connection to others is based on resonance and feeling "in tune"
- Disturbances in charge can lead to illness, reducing power available for normal functions
- Microbes emit frequencies that can distort body's fields for diagnostic purposes
- Electromagnetic spectrum includes various measurable fields, only a small fraction of which is visible light
- Research focuses on electromagnetic aspects due to extensive research in this area

**Backgrounder on Fields and Frequencies**

- Every part of the body generates fields and frequencies
- Fields help keep us organized
- Weak fields can add up to stronger ones, sometimes measurable
- Biological state indicated by generated fields and frequencies
- Emotions, thoughts also generate fields and frequencies
- Chemical reactions involve energy pulse and dielectric effect in the form of frequencies
- Frequencies have specific formulas and energies connected to them
- Vibrating correct frequency creates response without energy exchange or transfer
- Resonance occurs when frequencies match, causing amplification of vibrations
- Disturbances in charge lead to illness, reducing power available for normal functions
- Microbes emit frequencies that can distort body's fields for diagnostic purposes

**Electromagnetic Spectrum and Chakras**

- Electromagnetic spectrum includes various measurable fields
- Only a small fraction of the spectrum is visible light
- Chakras reflect higher vibration of visible light, but effects spread throughout all known and unknown radiations
- Scientific research focuses on electromagnetic aspects due to extensive research in this area
- Tools used for measurement include ECG, EEG, MCG, SQIDs, and detection of infrared radiation and biophotons.

### MEASURING CHAKRAS’ FIELDS AND FREQUENCIES
 
* **GDV Camera**: High-voltage electrophotography process developed by Konstantin Korotkov in Russia for detecting photons emitted from fingertips, revealing biofield effects from chakras and meridians. 
* **Hunt Studies (1970s)**: University of California research on electromagnetic radiation from the body during rolfing massage, revealing high-frequency oscillations from seven basic chakra areas.
	+ Chakra frequencies: 100-1,600 cps, higher than other body parts.
	+ Auric field study: Discovered colors and wave patterns associated with each auric layer and corresponding chakras.
	+ Highest frequencies generated by psychics, healers, or spiritually advanced individuals. 
* **Bioenergy Fields Monitor**: Instrument developed by Valerie Hunt to measure auric fields up to 750,000 cps, revealing different disease patterns and emotional/physical health states. 
* **Chakra Causes of Diseases**: According to Hunt, diseases caused by factors beyond traditional medicine, including viruses, oxygen deprivation, inflammation, and imbalanced energy fields. 
* **Scalar Waves (Bioscalar Waves)**: Energy that occupies space and can expand outward in circles, influencing the blood and lymphatic systems, improving fluid flow and healing.
	+ Healers believe scalar waves are vital force animating chakras.
	+ Some people fear destructive nature of scalar waves. 
* **Healing with Scalar Waves**: Correct chakra imbalance or dysfunction by generating scalar waves from the heart's scalar field, linking all chakra centers together (Stephen Linsteadt).

### MOTOYAMA TESTS FOR CHAKRA FUNCTIONS

**Motoyama's Research on Chakra Functions and Connections:**

* Hiroshi Motoyama studied the existence and functions of chakras and their connections to bodily systems. 
* **His findings align closely with standard Hindu theory, but with some differences**:
 * **First Chakra**: Sacral and coccygeal plexuses, urogenital system
 * **Second Chakra**: Sacral plexus, urogenital system, respiratory system
 * **Third Chakra**: Solar plexus, digestive system
 * **Fourth Chakra**: Cardiac plexus, circulatory systems, respiratory system
 * **Fifth Chakra**: Superior, middle, and interior cervical ganglia
 * **Sixth Chakra**: Pituitary body, interbrain, autonomic nervous system, endocrine system, entire nervous system
 * **Seventh Chakra**: Cerebral cortex, entire nervous system, organs and tissues of the entire body 
* **Motoyama's tests showed that chakra activity affects disease susceptibility**:
 * **Group A**: Advanced chakra activity - highest susceptibility to disease and functional troubles in linked organs
 * **Group B**: Beginning chakra activity - middle susceptibility
 * **Group C**: Dormant chakras - lowest susceptibility
* Motoyama also discovered a link between the cardiovascular system and the fourth (heart-based) chakra.
  * Yogis and long-term spiritual practitioners exhibit large rhythmic fluctuations in basal blood flow, indicating autonomic nerve control. 
* **Motoyama classified psi abilities into two categories**:
  * Powers of reception - linked to lower chakras
  * Powers of generation - linked to higher chakras
* Some individuals have naturally stronger chakras due to past experiences (karma).
* Motoyama's studies showed that concentrating on the chakras can activate them and produce measurable physical changes, such as creating light.

### A COMPLETE PICTURE OF CHAKRAS AS BANDS OF FREQUENCY

**Chakras as Bands of Frequency**

- Each chakra associated with a band of vibrational frequencies.
- Includes color and sound.
- Connects stars to smallest atom movements in the body.
- No limit to interactions between chakras and other frequencies.

**Frequencies in the Universe**

- Infinite combinations of frequencies.
- Some intersect matter, most are open.
- Matter and energy operate on unique vibrational levels.
- Everything rides on a pi radial string of numerical sequences.
- Interacting frequencies form information storage bins.
- Particles, molecules, and bundles of molecules are multidimensional.

**Interconnectedness and Memory**

- Traveling through and along universal frequencies.
- Humans are storage systems with encoded memories.
- Epigenes contain ancestors' memories and determine gene expression.
- Bodies are memory units containing thoughts, feelings, and experiences.
- Brain involved in chemical, electrical, and neurological activity.
- Linked to past contacts and future possibilities.
- Access to universal frequencies and knowledge.

**Chakras as Multidimensional Portals**

- Exist on all levels of being.
- Operate at measurable color and sound frequencies.
- Harmonically interact with other frequencies.
- Interaction points for sympathetic resonance.
- Need matching frequencies to allow shifts in neurological and endocrine capabilities.
- Practitioners perceive interaction points intuitively.

**Measuring Frequencies**

- Wavelengths presented in nanometers (nm).
- Frequencies presented in gigahertz (GHz).
- Color wavelengths and frequencies calculated using the speed of light.

**Color Spectrum**

- Each color is a frequency range.
- Perception of color shifts when enough particles change.

**Chakras and Colors**

- Chakras can be associated with colors and their corresponding tones
- Tones have frequencies, like colors
- No universal agreement on which note or pitch matches each chakra
- **Typical association**: C for first chakra, D for second, etc. (Chapter 15)

**Scientific Approach**

- Speed of light in a vacuum as constant
- Audible frequencies range between 20 and 25,000 Hz
- Use wavelength to find frequency associated with each color and chakra
- **Formula**: Frequency = (constant speed in a vacuum) / (wavelength)
- Octaves result from doubling or halving frequency
- Chakra Hertz Tone
 * **First**: 757.53 G♭ (Hz)
 * **Second**: 845.89 A♭ (Hz)
 * **Third**: 472.27 A♯ (Hz)
 * **Fourth**: 527.35 C (Hz)
 * **Fifth**: 588.86 D (Hz) (as blue)
 * **Sixth**: 657.54 E (Hz) (as violet)

**Body's Signature Sound**

- Body has its own unique sound according to John Evans
- Sacral nerves are parasympathetic, upper thoracic and lumbar sympathetic
- Endocrine positions correlate with chakra resonances and colors of each gland
- Acupuncture points link spinal positions to internal organs
- Meridians can be perceived as tones in a chromatic sequence
- All parts of the body vibrate at their own rates, creating individual instrumentation in the "orchestra" of self
- Chakras are doorways to access other parts of being
- Each set of frequencies needs to operate within a range of vibration for health and balance
- We emanate our own healthy sound, or the sound of the "true self," through chakra medicine.

### CHAKRAS IN MULTIPLEX: LADDERS OF LIGHT

**Chakras in Multiple Reality:**

- Chakras exist in multiple levels of reality, acting as organs for converting energy between different planes.
- **Several layers of reality and their dimensions**:
 * **Etheric layer**: Three dimensions
 * **Astral layer**: Four dimensions
 * **Mental layer**: Five dimensions
 * **Causal layer**: Five dimensions
 * **Buddhic layer**: Six dimensions
- All living beings can access these dimensions through major chakras.
- **Graduated access to layers**: Humans have evolved from physical to astral plane.
- Layers differ in frequency and other properties.
- Physical dimension is primarily mitigated by electromagnetism.
- Higher planes are more complex, often described with geometrical images.

**Functioning of Seven Basic Chakras:**

- Lower chakras process denser energy and draw from lower layers of reality.
- Higher chakras are more complex and reach into higher frames of reality.

**Etheric Layer (Three Dimensions):**

- Lower chakras operate here, focusing on physical health and vitality.

**Astral Plane:**

- Accessible through the heart chakra (fourth chakra).
- Chakras unique to this layer help us connect with emotions and desires.

**Mental Layer (Five Dimensions):**

- Throat chakra (fifth chakra) operates here, facilitating communication and self-expression.
- Third Eye chakra (sixth chakra) helps in intuition and perception.

**Causal Layer (Five Dimensions):**

- Crown chakra (seventh chakra) connects us to higher consciousness and spiritual growth.

**Buddhic Layer (Six Dimensions):**

- Chakras specific to this layer help in cosmic consciousness and enlightenment.

**Etheric Chakras:**

- Extends beyond skin, governs physical functions and energy exchange
- Partially composed of electromagnetic field and torsion field
- Interacts with DNA, directs growth and healing
- Template for physical body, sends commands through acupuncture meridians
- Enables cell specialization in embryonic stage
- Looks like a net of energy lines, colors range from blue to gray
- Establishes matrixes for cells and organs
- All seven major chakras operate at this level

**Astral Chakras:**

- Linked with feelings, emotions, and desires
- Located one to two feet beyond physical body
- Penetrates entire physical body, expands during strong emotional states
- Often called "rainbow body" or "seven in-body chakras"
- **Three levels**: high, middle, lower astral plane
- High astral plane for enlightened beings, middle for souls of living and deceased, lower for entities with challenging issues
- Absorbs soul and memories after physical death
- Astral body looks like a vortex of rainbow colors

**Mental Chakras:**

- Five-dimensional reality focusing on intellect and consciousness
- Memory and imagination dominate
- Information is shared through waves not subject to time or distance
- Lower mental body part of personality, higher mental body spiritual in nature
- Higher mental body concerned with abstract thinking and principles
- Often perceived as yellow and structured
- Every major chakra can receive both lower and higher mental ideas

**Causal Chakras:**

- Equated with higher mental body, deals with formless thoughts
- Carries memories and karma from lifetime to lifetime
- Allows us to manifest experiences
- Not well defined as chakras, called the karana sharira in Sanskrit
- Causes both gross and subtle bodies to exist as illusions

**Buddhic Chakras:**

- Overlap with other beings at highest levels
- Separateness falls away, perceive others' consciousness as our own
- Gain wisdom from others' experiences without participating in harmful activities
- Links to fifth chakra by some experts, communication center for Buddha's teachings. Others affiliate it with different chakras.

### CHAKRAS AND EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT
**Chakras and Embryonic Development**

- Grant McFetridge's theory: chakras exist in embryonic state, fully developed chakra system is a fused disk in solar plexus area for "flow awareness"
  - Chakras anchor into meridians, problems can cause depletion or hyperactivity
  - Chakras are devices run by aspects of consciousness, not mini brains
- Precellular brains contain chakras, egg has seven major chakras, sperm has heart-brain with chakra balls
  - Ideal fusion results in single smooth-edged chakra in solar plexus area
  - Trauma during fusion can cause imperfections, resulting in typical seven-chakra pattern
- Chakras visible as physical structures attached to nuclear membrane after fertilization, fetus copies mother's chakras
- Dr. Scroggins' theory: initial code sequence is accessible throughout life, affects genes, attitudes, and behaviors
  - Science might analyze first code for development prediction

**Gap Junctions Theory of Chakras**

- Gap junctions explain how chakras could operate physically
- Formed by proteins arranged in hexagonal shapes, involved in electrical conduction
- Synchronize hormone secretions, help neurons fire, relate neurons to glial cells, coordinate activity in embryological development
- Chakras related to gap junctions that link autonomic cells and central nervous system
  - Three main activities: physical base, concentration point, influence over glandular secretions
- Higher chakras not directly linked to neural cells but could remain connected through bones and cartilage formed from neural crest cells
- Affiliated with hormone systems, affecting endocrine functions
- Yoga training provides access to subtle electrical circuits related to chakras and kundalini
- High concentration of gap junction–linked cells at end of spinal column associated with coccyx and first chakra mechanisms.

**Chakra Structure:**
 
* **Yin-yang balance**: flow energy to left and right sides, share information with the world
* Front and back process different information (everyday vs. supernatural)
* Inner wheel manages spiritual function, outer wheels help adapt to external world
* Spin created by magnetic resonance, bilateral symmetry, and electrical currents near spine 
* **Torus shape**: donut-like energy flow through and around body
* Two-ended trumpet depiction of chakra as two connected spherical tori
* Chakras can be pictured as a torus with a vacuum or zero-point field inside
* Electrical currents near spine cause spin directions (right side has positively charged current, left side has negatively charged current)
* Odd-numbered chakras usually spin counterclockwise, even-numbered chakras spin clockwise.

**Chakras and electrical flow**:
* Logic suggests disturbances change chakra directions to torsion waves (spin waves)
* Torsion waves explain preservation of entropy (disorder and information in universe)
* Entropy increases = information disappears = right-handed torsion = clockwise spin
* Entropy decreases = information appears = left-handed torsion = counterclockwise spin
* Counterclockwise spins add energy, clockwise spins subtract energy, but this may be influenced by inner/outer chakra wheels and identification with them.
* Inner wheel: reflects spiritual essence, clockwise brings in energy, counterclockwise exits energy
* Outer wheel: holds programming, reflects wounded self, clockwise loses energy, counterclockwise gains energy
* Mirror experiments reverse torsion polarity, causing opposite effects on energy gain/loss
* Chakra medicine practitioners can shift time and space, producing miraculous results
* Torsion waves may alter time and frequency, creating antigravity effect or easier ESP based on left-handed or right-handed spins.

### WHICH WAY IS THE CHAKRA SPINNING?

**Chakras and Their Spin**

- Chakras can be seen as toroid fields based on the distribution of density or capacity ratio and gravitational field at the center
- **Positive gravitational field**: clockwise spin
- **Negative gravitational field**: counterclockwise spin
- Similar to planetary rotation

**Chakras Depicted as Lotuses**

- Two rotating propellers creating a lotus pattern when frequencies are not equal
- Distinct divisions of a circle when rotation rates are inconsistent
- High numbers of petals indicate little difference, lower numbers can occur due to resonance
- Frequency ratios in near unity cause vectors to spiral inward and outward, forming a vortex

**Chakras as Multifaceted Organs**

- Intertwined with neurological and biochemical systems
- Psychophysiological, electromagnetic, sonic, and part of embryonic development
- Etheric organs, members of a greater subtle energy body family
- Each level of reality has its own chakric system (etheric, astral, mental, causal, buddhic planes)
- Structurally established on a band of frequency with energy flow, spin, and shape

**Chakras as Divine Vehicles**

- Reinforce belief that we are divine beings in human bodies
- **Require special activation for functioning**: kundalini, the divine flame (subject of next chapter)

## 22. KUNDALINI RISES: THE CHAKRA SERPENT

**Kundalini:**

- Cosmic energy with various names across cultures
- Depicted as a coiled serpent at the base of the spine
- Rises through chakras, provoking enlightenment
- Key to chakra medicine and merging human and spiritual qualities

**Traditional Hindu Storyline:**

- **Kundalini**: Sanskrit word meaning "spiral" or "coil"
- Feminine goddess Shakti, depicted as a serpent coiled at the base of the spine
- References in Indian texts dating back to 3000 BCE
- Described as an aspect of supreme consciousness with and without form or attribute
- Personified as the Divine Mother or great goddess
- **Three manifestations**: purna-kundalini, prana-kundalini, urdhva kundalini
- Each level relates to one of three realms of existence (radiant emptiness, energy, appearance of form)
- Complexities include blocks, locks, detours, and intricacies

**Awakening Kundalini:**

- **Aim**: To become true selves
- Awakens from repose and travels up the spine through sushumna nadi
- Stimulates chakras, clearing path toward enlightenment
- Unites with Shiva in the crown chakra (Shakti and Shiva are dualistic aspects of Brahman)

**Science:**

- Neurological, hormonal, electromagnetic aspects to be explored later in the text.

### A HOMEWARD JOURNEY

**A Homeward Journey (Shakti's Ascension)**

- Shakti's ascension is a homeward journey to regain wholeness and freedom from illusion.
- During Creation (uppercase C) and individual creation (lowercase c), Shakti descends from the crown chakra to lower chakras as jagan mohini.
  * Forgets natural power and subtlety, causing maya (delusion).
  * Becomes physical and loses connection to higher awareness.
- Upon reawakening, Shakti transforms back into the subtle and undergoes laya-absorption.
  * Veils of maya disintegrate, revealing our true nature.
  * Descent causes ignorance and bondage; ascent leads to freedom and wisdom.
- Kundalini Shakti is our connection to higher awareness even in a dormant state.
- Kundalini manages biological functions and psychology during manifestation.
- Kundalini transcends form when united with Shiva, becoming unlimited consciousness.
- Revealer of our soul songs that become clearer as we mature in kundalini awakening.

**The Stages of the Kundalini Climb**

- **Purification**: Preparation for the upward climb.
  * Cleansing body, mind, and emotions.
- **Activation**: Kundalini arousal or awakening.
 * **Physical symptoms**: heat, vibrations, emotional release.
- **Rising**: Kundalini's journey through nadis and chakras.
  * Each chakra presents unique challenges and opportunities for growth.
- **Integration**: Living in—and as—light.
  * Embracing the transformative effects of kundalini awakening.
  * Continuous process of spiritual evolution.

### THE FIRST KUNDALINI STAGE: PURIFICATION

**Kundalini Stage 1: Purification**

- Preparation for kundalini awakening can be conscious or unconscious
- Groundwork laid through daily activities, spiritual paths, or personal growth
- **Techniques for intentional awakening**: prayer, meditation, compassionate living, yoga practices
- **Seven sadhanas in traditional yoga theory**: Sat-karma, Asanas, Mudras, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dhyana, Samadhi
- Eight-limbed yoga adds yamas, niyamas, and dharana
- **Three main philosophies of kundalini cultivation**: strict and intense practices, inner bliss approach, shaktipat initiation

**Sadhanas (Daily Spiritual Practices)**

**Bodily cleansing (Sat-karma)**
- Asanas (Postures)
- Mudras (Hand gestures)
- Pranayama (Breath control)
- Pratyahara (Withdrawal of senses)
- Dhyana (Meditation)
- Samadhi (Ecstasy)
  *Two types: savikalpa and nirvikalpa*

**Yoga Traditions**

- Jnana, Raja, Laya, Hatha, Mantra yoga
- Seven basic sadhanas in various traditions

**Philosophies of Kundalini Cultivation**

1. Strict and intense practices
   - Aim at a kundalini awakening
   - "Arouse the sleeping serpent by seizing its tail" (Pradipika)
2. Inner bliss approach
   - Experience inner bliss of self decreases attachment to bodily pleasures and temptations (Abhinava Gupta, Tantraloka)
3. Shaktipat initiation
   - Transfer of awakening energy from teacher to student

### THE SECOND KUNDALINI STAGE: ACTIVATION

- **Kundalini can be activated in various ways**: deliberate cultivation, spontaneously, traumatic events, dreams, sexual experiences, spiritual eureka moments, or in utero influences.
  * Individuals may be born partially aroused or fully awakened due to parental influences, past life accomplishments, intense loving circumstances, or severe abuse.
  * Epigenetic memories can trigger kundalini activation.

**Energetic Activation Process**

- **Prerequisites**: smooth energy flow in the three nadis (ida, pingala, sushumna) and balanced prana distribution.
- Kundalini pierces chakras if energies are uneven.
- Kundalini sleeps in the first chakra, wrapped in coils in the sacrum bone.
  * Compared to the Holy Grail or Vishnu's steps.
 * **Coils represent qualities**: sattva, rajas, tamas, and human capacity for transcendence.
- Kundalini sleeps facing downward with her mouth at the Brahma hole.
- Kundalini can be poison or nectar; when awakened, it leads to expansion toward divinity.
- Kundalini is woven around a lingam, a symbol of ascending force and unification of male and female energies.

### THE THIRD KUNDALINI STAGE: RISING

**The Third Kundalini Stage: Rising**

- The rising process is challenging due to two sets of energetic blocks.

**Energetic Blocks (Lingas)**

- Three lingas act as caps that kundalini must break through.
- Represent forms of Shiva within the sushumna.
- Each linga associated with a chakra and its challenges.

**Svayambhu Linga**

- Occupies space where sushumna attaches to kanda.
- Related to first chakra.
- Physically situated between anus and root of reproductive organ.
- Beautiful, molten gold color and shape.
- Head points downward in small triangle or faces west with split head.
- Blocked by sleeping kundalini.
- Roused by contact with fire, mind, and vital force.

**Bhana Linga and Itara Linga**

- Associated with fourth and sixth chakras, respectively.
- Encourage working through challenges of mind and self-perception.

**Granthi (Locks)**

- Prevent kundalini's ascension after arousal.
- Lingas and granthi may be the same or interrelated.

**Three Granthis**

**Brahma Granthi**

- First grantha at base of spine.
- Represents Brahma, god of creation.
- Kundalini cannot pass until beyond senses' desires and manifestation.

**Vishnu Granthi**

- Second grantha at fourth chakra.
- Associated with Vishnu, god of preservation.
- Initiate must use compassion to serve others instead of self.

**Rudra Granthi**

- Third grantha at sixth chakra.
- Linked to Rudra, Shiva as god of destruction.
- Person must embrace higher truths to ascend to seventh chakra.

**Kundalini can collapse back into elements through Laya yoga, dissolving tattvas (templates of form)**

* **Tattvas include five elements, each associated with chakras**: earth (smell), water (taste), fire (sight), air (touch), ether (sound)
* In sixth chakra, lower mind (manas) dissolves into higher mind (buddhi), then into matrix of nature (sukshma-prakriti)
* Kundalini ascends through sushumna, piercing six chakras and reaching triveni in sixth chakra
* Triveni is located at medulla oblongata, where it merges with divine masculine energy in crown chakra
* Kundalini passes through lingas and granthis at each chakra, affecting metabolism and triggering emotional issues
* Fifth chakra stores nectar (amrita) which can be poisonous or healthful, depending on awakening of throat chakra
* Sixth chakra combines three gunas and bindus to create higher virtues
* Kundalini passes through visarga bridge before entering seventh chakra
* Visarga bridge is also called bindu visarga, source of bindu fluid (nectar or poison)
* Once kundalini reaches brahmarandhra, enlightenment is confirmed and bindu fluid may be released
* Kundalini ascension purifies neurological, hormonal, and other systems related to each chakra.

### THE SYMPTOMS OF A KUNDALINI RISING

| --- | --- |
| Love | Heart |
| Anger | Heart, hands, throat area, feet |
| Happiness | Head and heart |
| Depression | All chakras (lack of brightness) |
| Shame | Sixth chakra (eyes) |

**Kundalini Stages and Symptoms**

- Symptoms dependent on person's process and type of rising
- Understanding the scope and breadth of potential risings is helpful. (Details not provided in text.)

### THE WINDING ROUTES OF KUNDALINI

**Kundalini Rising: Six Main Routes**

- **Six main routes for kundalini ascension**: sushumna, vajra, chitrini, brahma, saraswati, and lakshmi nadis
- Most common risings occur on sushumna, vajra, and saraswati paths

**Stages of Kundalini Rising**

- **No Rising**: Kundalini remains in the first chakra

- **Kundalini Stirring**: Kundalini shaken but doesn't ascend

- **Kundalini Arousal**: Kundalini uncoils and withdraws, may pull subject into darker aspects of first chakra

- **Kundalini Release**: Kundalini exits the first chakra, elevates to achievable chakra level

- **Partial Rising**: Kundalini reaches heart but gets stuck under bhana linga

- **Intermediate Rising**: Kundalini rises through sushumna, breaks through bhana linga, remains at throat or lower brow

- **Deflected Rising**: Kundalini deflected to vajra or saraswati nadi, results in instability

- **Faux Full Rising**: Kundalini pierces itara linga but remains at lower point of sixth chakra

- **Full Rising**: Kundalini rises through sushumna, breaks through itara linga, reaches sixth chakra's highest point and bindu

**Routes After Full Rising**

- **Upper Vajra Nadi**: Causes chakra-by-chakra purge from the highest part of the sixth chakra

- **Upper Chitrini Nadi**: Causes spontaneous bodily and breath patterns via brahmarandhra

- **Upper Brahma Nadi**: Stimulates increased awareness through granthi, triveni, and hrit

**Completion of Rising**

- **Blossoming of chitrini nadi**: Kundalini enters spiritual communion with visarga and merges with pure consciousness at bindu

**Other Possible Routes**

- Direct rising through chitrini or Brahma nadi to bindu
- Left-hand tantric practices between vowed partners, resulting in profound ecstasy and elevated mind capacity

**Plateau Phase**

- **Shuddha Beha**: Purification of the body
- **Pranava Beha**: Improvement of the mind and brain
- **Jnana Beha**: Refinement of higher intelligence
- **Liberation**: Union of the soul with the One
- **Realized Being**: Jivanmukti, able to maintain presence on celestial planes while merging with pure consciousness.

### THE FOURTH KUNDALINI STAGE: INTEGRATION

- Physical process:
  * Increased production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate).
  * Release of endorphins and other neurotransmitters.
  * Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system.
  * Changes in brain chemistry and structure.
  * DNA transformation.

### THE UNIVERSAL NATURE OF KUNDALINI

**Kundalini: A Universal Concept**

- Kundalini transcends religion and ethnicity, present in various cultures and spiritual practices
- Present in scriptures of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity as a fire or serpent
- Ancient Middle Eastern communities worshipped the serpent image with healing and transformational associations

**Religions and Spiritual Practices**
 
* **Islam**: Salaat system acknowledges divine female counterpart Al-at, associated with kundalini 
* **Judaism**: Shekkina, feminine energy; Hebrew letters considered holy, representing male and female aspects of the Divine 
* **Christianity**: Kundalini compared to Holy Spirit 
* **Taoism**: Lao Tze describes kundalini as spirit of the valley, linked to the Divine 
* **Buddhism**: Lord Buddha speaks about middle path for achieving nirvana, possibly describing sushumna and kundalini

**Other Cultures**
 
* **!Kung people (Africa)**: Practice involves heating up n/um energy through dance and achieving a state equivalent to kundalini rising 
* **Modern African esoteric school**: Uroboros practice involves generating heat in lower abdomen and directing energy upward

**Symbolism of the Serpent**

- Found worldwide as symbolic signature of kundalini energy
- Can represent supportive or detrimental forces, depending on culture
- Allusion to caduceus, staff of Hermes, Greek messenger god, associated with healing and medicine
- Symbolizes DNA, double helix governing life, health, and emotions
- Ancient Mesopotamian creator god EA or ENKI depicted as serpent, believed to encode wisdom into humans' genes.

### KUNDALINI AND THE CHRISTIAN TRADITION

**Kundalini and Christianity**

- Kundalini and the Holy Spirit have similarities in both Hindu and Christian traditions
- Kundalini is portrayed as a feminine Divine Mother in Hinduism
- The Holy Spirit in Old Testament and Jewish Torah is also referred to as feminine or neutral
- The term ruah, meaning Holy Spirit in Semitic languages, is feminine
- The Holy Spirit was originally perceived as feminine in early Christian texts
  - Gospels of Thomas and Philip, Acts of Thomas refer to the Holy Spirit as feminine
  - Prayers invoke the Holy Spirit as "mother of all creation" and "compassionate mother"
- Kundalini is a complex mother figure
  - Kind and benevolent, but also explosive and flammable
  - Her purpose is to ignite, purify, and leave us renewed with spiritual gifts
- Kundalini is related to fire in Hinduism
  - Instructions for kindling the fire of kundalini in ancient texts
  - Kundalini is a personal mother who leads to self-realization and heaven on earth
- The Holy Spirit is also related to fire in Christianity
  - God is related to fire in Old Testament
  - Tongues of fire descend on the disciples at Pentecost, bringing rebirth and spiritual gifts
- Both kundalini and the Holy Spirit lead to self-realization and the awakening of spiritual gifts
- Kundalini is not just for personal gain or extrasensory benefits, but for self-knowledge and compassion for others.

### KUNDALINI IN THE BODY: THE SCIENCE OF THE SHAKTI

* Kundalini is a physical and subtle energy that affects the entire body
* Distinction between prana and kundalini:
  * Prana is life energy, exists where there is life, serves as a medium for physical energy
  * Kundalini is more defined and purposeful, experienced as internal heat, involved in activating chakras

**Prana:**

* Exists everywhere, sum of all hidden and manifested energies in the universe
* Five forms: prana, apana, samana, udana, vyana
* Flows through nadis, serves as life energy pulsing through channels
* Some believe chakras are formed from nadis

**Kundalini:**

* More limited and defined than prana
* Experienced as internal heat, involved in activating chakras
* Biologically related to microcurrents in the body
* Activation begins with a shift in the aorta, results in magnetic fields and hormonal shifts
* Increases intuitive awareness, telepathy, social functioning, relaxation, and spiritual growth

**Prana vs. Kundalini:**

* Some argue prana and kundalini are the same, we perceive them differently
* Others propose aiming for a "pranic awakening" to clear kundalini blockages
* Atman is the universal source of all energy, both prana and kundalini originate from it.

### The Neurology and Hormonal Activity of Kundalini

**Kundalini Transformation:**

- Autonomic system involved, regulates bodily functions without conscious control
- **Ideal outcome**: self-control and spiritual gifts
- Physical metamorphosis similar to caterpillar becoming a butterfly
- Radical transformation can be painful and frightening
- **Kundalini awakening in nested cycles**: alarm and recovery states

**Neurological Complexities:**

- Occurs at base of spine, first chakra
- Rich in gap junctions and nerve excitation
- Sushumna is a column of gap junction–linked cells
- Practices like meditation and yoga increase prevalence of gap junctions
- Sympathetic and parasympathetic systems involved

**Alarm State:**

- Sympathetic nervous system dominates
- Peak experiences, heightened adrenal function
- Production of "flight, fight, or freeze" neurochemicals and hormones
- Immune system activation, body begins building new version of itself
- Increased heat, tingling, electrical flow in spine
- Glutamate overstimulation, hyperactivity in cells
- Potential for prolonged hypothyroidism, inhibited T4 to T3 conversion, thyroid issues, cholesterol increase, stress-related conditions, emotional instability

**Recovery State:**

- Parasympathetic nervous system dominates
- **Hormonal release**: vasopressin and oxytocin
- Brings peace and calm after sympathetic burnout
- Preparation for next kundalini cycle

### THE RECOVERY STATE—THE KUNDALINI SHAKEDOWN

**Recovery State**

- Balancing state after alarm state
- Triggered by opiate receptors and nitric oxide
- Creates a sense of bliss and pause
- Repair of cellular damage by lysosomes

**Cellular Repair**

- Lysosomes degrade unwanted material
- Ignore neurotransmitters like serotonin, GABA, and amino acids
- Flood of inhibitory neurotransmitters to stop excitement

**Parasympathetic Response**

- Brainstem stimulates parasympathetic response
- Turns on dorsal vagus complex (DVC)
- Heart expands and supports DVC activity
- Increased cell division during parasympathetic periods
- Individuals report feeling like they are glowing

**Heart Dominance**

- Love rules when heart assumes dominance
- Sympathetic nervous system kicks in between parasympathetic periods
- Nesting cycles continue until kundalini climbs into higher spiritual chakras

**Enlightening State**

- Shakti merges with Shiva in the pineal gland
- **Physiological changes**: increased blood flow, biophotons, and inhibitory neurotransmitters
- Increased spiritual activity in higher chakra areas
- Transcendental visions and psychic insights
- Stimulation of occipital lobe and pituitary hormones

**Kundalini and EMF (Electromagnetic Field)**

- To be discussed further in next topic.

### KUNDALINI’S ELECTROMAGNETIC CAPACITIES

* The body functions electromagnetically with bioelectrical processing and powerful electrostasis fields in nearly every tissue
* Presence of neuropeptides, ions, and other biochemicals responsible for bioelectrical functioning
* Body is a dipole magnet with north pole in the center of the brain (crown chakra or Shiva) and south pole at genitals (first chakra or Shakti)
* Polarity exists even at conception, established in cells and body systems
* Spine is the connecting channel for bioelectrical power transmitted from the brain to organs
* Upper end of spinal cord positively charged, lower end negatively charged
* Chakras related to pineal, pituitary, hypothalamus, brahmarandhra, and crown are part of north or upper pole
* During kundalini process, negative and positive polarities become more pronounced, increasing ion exchanges and electrical charges
* Increased enzymatic action and oxygen use lead to production of ATP and boost glucose metabolism
* Spine becomes more ionized during a kundalini awakening, fluid within it supercharges with ions and neurotransmitters
* Fluid circulates through spine into organs and brain, "electrifying" the bloodstream
* Increased electrical state enhances vortex energies in body
* Two poles of EMF in body find shortest distance between them and unite through sushumna
* Lines of force emanate from bodily north poles, enter opposite side, and form spinning vortexes along positive-negative axis of spine
* Kundalini intensifies all these movements and amplifies EMF emanating from and surrounding the body
* Greater kundalini activity, stronger EMF; stronger EMF, more intense kundalini experience
* Body's EMF affected by various factors including solar and lunar impacts on atmosphere
* Individuals with thin EMF fields can be more susceptible to external stimulation and intensify kundalini activation
* Goal of kundalini experience is to direct own energy toward positive end.

### A SUMMATIVE EMF THEORY

**A. Summative EMF Theory (Bentov's "Progressive Sensory-Motor Cortex Syndrome" or "Physio-Kundalini Cycles")**

* Oscillation of microcurrents increases during meditation
* Formation of a standing wave in the aorta
* Heart rate, respiratory rate, and diaphragm descent interrelate with aortic motion
* Entrainment of heart-aorta system with body
* "Lighting up" of sensory and motor cortex points corresponding to kundalini path
* Vibrations in cerebral ventricles caused by acoustical standing waves in the heart
* Polarization of cortex and activation of pleasure centers
* Entire body moves in rhythm, causing kundalini reflex and sensations (tingling, electrical discharges, bliss)
* Formation of two pulsating magnetic fields around head
* Both sides of brain become equally available after completion of kundalini circuit
* Enlightened person tuned in to world around them and other energies in the solar system and universe

**B. EMF and Kundalini (Motoyama's Research)**

* Increased amplitude around head during meditation
* Micromotions on left greater than right before meditation
* Equal micromotions on left and right during meditation, indicating transcendent state
* Cultivation of kundalini through chakra medicine techniques recommended for gradual process
* Spontaneous awakening potentially difficult and traumatic

**C. Key Concepts**
 
* **Standing wave**: a wave confined by boundaries or formed when two waves meet 
* **Entrainment**: synchronization of two oscillating systems 
* **Sensory-motor cortex**: the part of the brain responsible for processing sensory information and initiating motor responses 
* **Cerebral ventricles**: fluid-filled cavities in the brain 
* **Chakra medicine techniques**: practices used to balance and open the energy centers in the body, also known as chakras.

### TIBETAN BUDDHISM AND THE CHANNEL WHEELS

* Tibetan Buddhism draws from Indian Buddhism and tantric ideas, including chakras for accessing wisdom and achieving emptiness.
* Chakras, or channel wheels, are part of our physical embodiment in Tibetan practices. 
* **Tibetan Buddhism acknowledges four main chakras**: navel (manipura), heart (anahata), throat (vishuddha), and top of the head (sahasrara or ajña). 
* **Differences from Hindu version**: Tibetan Buddhism may have 5, 7, or 10 channel wheels with varying spokes.
* Key to Tibetan Buddhist practice is vital energy and a structured subtle body called the vajra body.
* Vajra body relies on red and white subtle drops, channels, and winds for transformation and spiritual development.
* Channels are equated with nadis; wheels, or doors, with chakras.
* Red drops linked to blood, energy of fire, and navel center (manipura).
* White drops linked to inherited substances, sperm, higher subtle energies, and top head center (sahasrara or ajña).
* Winds are power fields that awaken movement and resist chaos; they produce transformation and spiritual development.
* Goal is to open the doors of the channel wheels and enable the winds' entrance into the central channel.

### THE TAOIST TRADITION

**Taoism**

- Religion originated in China over 2500 years ago, incorporating shamanic practices from as early as 6000 years ago
- Meaning "way" or "path," Taoism is a journey to the heart of the sublime and a road to bodily rejuvenation
- Harmony with the flux is key, but emperors sought to harness yogis for magical abilities
- Yogis protected their knowledge, resulting in piecemeal practices and secrecy
- Communism suppressed Taoism in the 1950s and 1960s, leading to limited information on alchemy

**Lessons from a Taoist Monk (Robert Piper)**

- Try until you get it right
- Answer to a question lies within
- Real wisdom comes from doing and failing
- Meditation helps recognize egotistical mind
- Compassion and resilience necessary for growth
- Patience is a virtue
- Detach from ego
- No self, no enemy
- Happiness comes from internal and external sources

**Taoist Grand Master Chang San-feng**

- Taoist priest born in 1247 CE, believed to be an immortal or xian
- Founder of Wudang Mountain culture associated with Taoist studies and practices
- Immune to elements, could fly, live on dew and air, and age slowly

**Taoist Subtle World**

- Three treasures: jing (essence), chi (vitality), shen (spirit)
- Three dantian: lower (jing), middle (chi), upper (shen)
- Lower dantian: seat of jing, located below navel, circulates essence
- Middle dantian: seat of chi, refines breath into spirit
- Upper dantian: seat of shen, divided into nine palaces or chambers, marks last state of neidan (internal alchemy)
- Neidan: physical, mental, and spiritual practices aimed at increasing longevity and creating an immortal spiritual body

**The Four Taoist Forces**

- Born with prenatal force, which can be recharged by accessing other forces: heavenly, cosmic, earth
- Dantian establish a three-part division of inner space and are linked with the three treasures

**Within this backdrop, our chi circulates through the physical and subtle body...**

* The microscopic circulation of chi in the body mirrors the macroscopic orbit of universal force in the galaxy
* Chi is essential for health and energy; lack of chi leads to sickness and aging
* Earth, heavenly, cosmic, and original chi are required for a healthy life
* Microcosmic orbit involves circulating energy through governing and conception channels 
* **Governing channel**: main yang channel, begins in perineum, runs up spinal column, ends at base of nose and upper lip 
* **Conception vessel**: main yin channel, starts at lower abdomen, connects with governing channel and microcosmic orbit
* Performing microcosmic and macrocosmic orbits fills meridians and enhances energy flow
* Earth force is red, sexual energy is pink, universal energy is violet, etc.
* Specific points important for circulation and access to external vibrations
* Circulation of energy results in golden elixir and bright light, key to higher consciousness
* Microcosmic orbit balances and integrates all chakras into one chakra
* Orbit regulates positively and negatively charged points opposite chakras, causing them to spin
* Increasing chi flow in the orbit amplifies and balances energy flowing through chakras
* Central channel (Thrusting Channel) serves as birth canal for spiritual rebirth as an immortal
* Expanding consciousness attracts higher frequencies of light, filling orbit with chi and creating human auric field
* Energy pulses into five gates in feet, perineum, heart/palms, third eye, and crown, linking personal microcosmic orbit to macrocosmic energies.

### OF TRIADS AND KUNDALINI AFIRE

**Kundalini and Fires in the Body**

- Kundalini is one type of fire among many in various bodies or sheaths
- Bailey's perspective: Kundalini activation connects 4th and 1st chakras through vagus nerves
- Result: Raising of kundalini, controlling vagus nerve, purifying body, opening chakra doors

**Kundalini's Purposes**

- Animates the body
- Increases vibratory rate of each center and atom
- Eliminates toxins and coarse matter
- Radiates physical fire between shoulder blades
- Blends three triads or channels of energy

**Three Triads or Channels of Energy**

- Head triad: Pineal gland, pituitary body, alta major center
- Triangle of prana: Between shoulders, above diaphragm, and spleen
- Base of spine: Between bottom of spinal column and sex organs

**Alta Major Center**

- Associated with throat center and autonomic nervous system
- Disturbance results from imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic parts
- Three physical centers of the head subdivide into four lesser centers in alta major

**Chakra Evolution**

- Circle: Saucerlike depression of dimly glowing light (least developed)
- Circle with a Point in the Center: Glowing fire in the middle, rapid rotation (mind becoming active)
- Divided Circle: Split vortex, bright flame casting off rays of fire (higher mental development)
- Circle Divided in Four: Active center and rotating cross within periphery (spiritual development)

**Extra Chakras According to Alice Bailey**

- Twenty-one auxiliary or minor chakras located all over the body
  - Ten bilateral minor chakras corresponding to different body parts
  - About three inches in diameter and one inch away from the body
- Forty-nine even smaller chakras where energy strands cross seven times (potentially correspond to acupuncture points)
- Bailey's secondary chakras located at specific points on the body.

### CHAKRAS AND THE EARTH’S SONGLINES 

* Ancestors referred to invisible lines of energy or matrixes as dragon lines, songlines, ley lines, vortexes, fairy paths, spirit lines, or dragon currents 
* **Indigenous Australians**: songlines, traced creators' journeys, connected to rainbow serpent 
* **Irish**: fairy paths, terminated at holy mountains 
* **Incans**: spirit lines, terminated at tops of holy mountains 
* **Ancient Germany**: holy lines, marked by sacred sites and natural objects 
* **Japan, China, India, Tibet**: dragon lines, honorable art among Chinese to determine flow of dragon currents 
* **North and South America**: energy lines or electromagnetic lines, vortexes 
* **Most common label**: ley lines, first conceived by Alfred Watkins in 1929
* Invisible straight and geometric alignments linked with places of geographical interest
* Ley markers often show location of a ley line, must start or finish on a hill 
* **Types of ley lines**: astronomy, funerary usage, magnetic, geometric alignments
* Use of ley lines in creation of pre-pagan and pagan sites started between 7000 and 6000 BCE 
* **Other earth-based lines**: Hartmann Grid, Benker Cubical System, Curry Grid, Black Lines 
* **Hartmann Grid**: network of charged lines that can send energy upward to six hundred feet, harmful radiation intensified at intersections 
* **Benker Cubical System**: composed of polarized energy tracks, negatively affects immune system 
* **Curry Grid**: mystical force field composed of crisscrossing lines, beneficial or harmful radiation at intersections 
* **Black Lines**: natural earth energies that don't run in lines but are localized and dangerous, increase negative effects during solar and lightning storms.

### HOW EARTH GRIDS ARE FORMED

**Earth Grids:**

- Formed through interaction between solar wind and earth's magnetic field
- Solar wind interacts with earth's magnetic field, creating an enormous generator
- Power emanates from the planet's core, creating currents called telluric currents
- Telluric currents produce magnetic or electromagnetic waves that cycle in one direction for 12 hours and opposite for another 12 hours
- Grids of low frequency longitudinal electrical waves form over millions of years
- Different types of grids, such as Hartmann and Curry grids or Benker Cubical System
- Conductors within gridlines produce more powerful emanations

**Earth Chakras:**

- Formed at intersections of grid lines
- Not every intersection forms a chakra, but hundreds or thousands exist
- **Major and minor chakras located in various places**: seas and oceans, mountains, caves, ancient sites
- Vortexes or spiraling energies found at earth's energetic intersections might be electrical, magnetic, or electromagnetic
- Formed due to non-dipole effect or universal matrix imbedded within the earth
- Sacred sites built at chakra or vortex points for tapping into universal consciousness
- Earth energy travels from one chakra to another, forming energetic pathways
- Structures built on negative natural lines or incoherently drain subtle energies and create undesirable effects.
