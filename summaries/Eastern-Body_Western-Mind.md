### WHEELS THAT HEAL

**Chakra System:** a seven-leveled philosophical model of the universe, originating in India over 4,000 years ago. Translates to "wheel" or "disk" in Sanskrit.

* Represents steps of ever-expanding states of consciousness.
* Centers of organization that receive, assimilate, and express life force energy.
* Seven major chakras stacked from base of spine to top of head; minor chakras in hands, feet, etc.

**Yoga:** a discipline designed to yoke together the individual with the divine using mental and physical practices.

**Chakra Characteristics:**

* Intangible, not physical entities, yet have strong effects on the body and mind.
* Programmed deep in the core of the mind-body interface.
* Influence glandular processes, body shape, chronic physical ailments, thoughts, and behavior.
* Can be influenced through techniques like yoga, breathing, meditation, etc.

**Chakra Locations:**

* Seven major chakras: Figure 0.1 shows their relative locations.
* Associated with various states of consciousness, archetypal elements, and philosophical constructs.

**Lower Chakras:** physically closer to the earth, related to practical matters and ruled by physical and social law.

* Chakra 1: Survival
* Chakra 2: Sexuality
* Chakra 3: Power

**Upper Chakras:** represent mental realms and work on a symbolic level through words, images, and concepts.

* Chakra 4: Love
* Chakra 5: Communication
* Chakra 6: Intuition
* Chakra 7: Consciousness itself

**Archetypal Elements:** associated with each chakra.

* Earth, water, fire, air, sound, light, thought

**Elements' Principles:** universal principles represented by each element.

* Gravitation, polarity, combustion, equilibrium, vibration, luminescence, consciousness itself

**Chakras as a ladder:** connecting the polarities of Heaven and Earth, mind and body, spirit and matter.

**Color Association:** seven colors in the rainbow; red for base chakra, violet for crown, and other colors represent steps between.

* Opening and healing chakras: becoming the Rainbow Bridge

**Table of Correspondences:** Figure 0.3 provides basic information about each chakra.

### THE HUMAN BIOCOMPUTER

**The Human Biocomputer: Understanding Chakras as Programs and Energy Flow**

* Chakras, meaning "disks," can be thought of as storage units for vital programs in our lives
* We have programs for survival, sexuality, power, love, and communication
* The seventh chakra represents the operating system that organizes and interprets all other programs
* Our programming is a result of cultural influences and personal experiences, some conscious and some unconscious
* The challenge is to identify these programs and rewrite them as necessary for healing
* Our body is the hardware, our programming is the software, and we are the user (Self)

**The Importance of Energy Flow in Understanding Chakras**

* Energy or life force activates all programs
* Human bodies have vertical major energy pathways and subtler currents running in other directions
* Two essential poles: earth-centered pole (grounding) and the pole of consciousness
* Grounding is the connection to the body and the material world for safety, stability, and centering
* Consciousness comes from the mind, organizes sensory information, and connects us to the spiritual realm
* The chakras act as channels for energy flow between these polarities, allowing us to tap into different frequencies of soul and spirit.

**Understanding Chakra Patterns**

* Each person has unique patterns of energy flow and expression through their behavior and environment
* Understanding these patterns can help identify how chakra programs are running our lives
* Some common patterns include ignoring the body (Sally), pushing people away while talking too much (George), and lack of success and poor self-image (Jane)

**Activating Our Programs: The Role of Energy Flow and Energetic Contact**

* Activation requires a charge of energy moving through the psychic currents of the body
* Grounding is the connection to the earth, providing safety, stability, and centering through sensation and feeling
* Consciousness connects us to our mind, memory, dreams, and beliefs, allowing for dynamic energy flow throughout our being.

### LIBERATION AND MANIFESTATION

**Liberation and Manifestation:**
- Liberation: path of transcendence, consciousness and matter combine to create chakras, current of consciousness moving downward (liberating current), historically seen as path to spiritual freedom.
- Manifestation: path of immanence, energy becomes denser as it descends, current of manifestation required for embodiment.
- Balance between both needed for wholeness.

**Chakras:**
- Seven vortices created by consciousness and matter.
- Downward flow of energy (current of manifestation) enters through the crown chakra and moves downward.
- Upward flow of energy (current of liberation) originates at base chakra.
- Both currents combine in the sacred marriage (hieros gamos), creating limitless possibilities.

**Obstacles to Liberation and Manifestation:**
- Physical pain, childhood traumas, social programming, oppressive environments can cut us off from ground and liberating current.
- Misinformation and indoctrination can invalidate consciousness and disconnect instincts and memories.

**Integration of Mind, Body, and Energy:**
- Both vertical (manifestation and liberation) and horizontal (reception and expression) currents are essential for wholeness.
- Integration of these currents leads to profound insight and healing.

**Reception and Expression:**
- Two horizontal currents flow into and out of each chakra, required for full range of expression and reception.
- Blockages in these currents can distort reception and expression.

**Balancing Reception and Expression:**
- Techniques to open and close each chakra, allowing for a full range of reception and expression.
- Balancing both vertical and horizontal currents crucial for personal evolution.

### CHAKRA BLOCKAGE
- A block develops when equal and opposing forces meet on a particular plane
- Cannot eliminate one force, must be integrated
- Blocks may relate to chakra function (communication, power, physical health, etc.)
- Contributors to chakra blockage: childhood traumas, cultural conditioning, limited belief systems, exhausting habits, physical and emotional injuries, lack of attention

**Effects of Chakra Blockage:**
- Difficulties in communication, fear and submission, physical health issues, financial crises
- Coping strategies become chronic patterns (defense structures)
- Tension in body (body armor) affects posture, breathing, metabolism, emotional states, perceptions, interpretations, belief systems
- Affects relationships, work, creativity, and belief systems
- Manifestations of incomplete or unbalanced experiences

**Impact on Energy Currents:**
- Unable to fully utilize liberating current, stuck on survival issues
- Unable to properly ground manifesting current, lost in ideas, unable to connect in real world
- Unable to receive certain types of energy (love, new information), chakra atrophies and functions further limited
- Unable to express energy, stagnation and closed system

**Quote from Nei Ching:**
- A block of any significant degree gains severity over time
- Small fears grow into full-blown phobias, anger leads to isolation, depression, and more anger
- Clinging in relationships creates abandonment, further holding on
- Any specific chakra block affects flow of four basic currents

**Healing Chakra Blockages:**
- Recognize blocks
- Understand source and meaning
- Develop tools for healing (meditation, therapy, yoga, etc.)

**Addressing Personal History**
- Examining developmental stages and traumas
- Understanding programming from each stage

**Applying Exercises and Techniques**
- Physical exercises to open specific parts of the body
- Meditations, real-world tasks, and visualization techniques

**Balancing Excess and Deficiency**
**Excess:**
- Overcompensation or avoidance of situations
- Chronic tension, excessive worrying, compulsive behavior
- Stiffened membranes preventing penetration
- Example: A densely overweight person may have an excessive first chakra

**Deficiency:**
- Withdrawal from situations
- Vague, unreliable, overly changeable
- Unglued membranes with porosity
- Example: A frightened person who talks constantly would have an excessive fifth chakra

**Excess and Deficiency: Coping Strategies**
- Result of stress, trauma, or unpleasant circumstances
- Both restrict the flow of energy through the system
- Dysfunctional behavior and health problems

**Healing Imbalances**
- Excessive chakras need to discharge energy
- Deficient chakras need to receive energy
- Difficult to open long-closed chakras
- Subtleties require individualized approach

**Multidimensional Healing Approach**
- Verbally through discussion
- Physically through work with the body and movement
- Spiritually through meditation
- Emotionally through exploration of feelings
- Visually through images
- Aurally through sounds
- Actualized through outer-world tasks that strengthen certain areas of our lives.

### CHARACTER ARMOR

**Character Armor:**
- A meeting place for psyche and soma (mind and body)
- Represents self-care practices and coping strategies
- Developed from difficulties during developmental stages
- Chronic holding patterns become automatic, beyond conscious awareness
- Not decided but rather "hardwired" into the system
- Correlates with distribution of energy through chakras

**John Conger:**
- Character provides a house for energy (shell)
- Excess and deficiency become chronic holding patterns (character armor)
- Character structure describes overall patterns of armoring in the body

**Character Structures:**
**Schizoid/Creative:**
- Split between mind and body
- Highly creative and intelligent
- Issues around right to exist
- Overdeveloped upper chakras
- Discussed in first chakra chapter

**Oral/Lover:**
- Developed from deprivation in nurturing stage
- Emotionally oriented towards merging and giving

**Masochist/Endurer:**
- Fixated at third chakra
- Energy bound at will
- Robbed of autonomy
- Turn blocked energy inward against self
- Strong and loyal, can endure difficulty well
- Positively referred to as Endurer structure
- Discussed in second or third chakra chapter

**Rigid/Achiever:**
- Wounded by lack of approval
- Focuses on achievement
- Highly functional but afraid of relationships and intimacy
- Discussed in fourth chakra chapter

**Hysteric:**
- Variation on Rigid/Achiever structure
- Occurs more often in women
- Emotions initially held back, later erupt with intensity
- Discussed in fifth chakra chapter

**Psychopath/Challenger-Defender:**
- Orientated towards power-over
- Defends the meek and challenges the strong
- Excessive rather than deficient development at third chakra

    * Reclaiming these rights is necessary for overall health and balance.

### THE SEVEN IDENTITIES

**Identity:** A constantly changing and expanding manifestation of the spirit that gives meaning and helps us operate in the world. It is important but can limit us if clung to.

**Seven Chakra Identities:**

* **Physical Identity (Chakra One):** The first identity level associated with self-preservation, identifying with the body and its physical qualities. Necessary for dealing with the physical world.
* **Emotional Identity (Chakra Two):** Beneath the surface of the body churn the emotions. Identity focused on feelings, "I feel therefore I am." Expands experience of the body and connects us to the flow of the world.
* **Ego Identity (Chakra Three):** Identification with our will, behavior, and actions. Realization of being a separate entity with the power to choose. Oriented towards self-definition. "I am what I do."
* **Social Identity (Chakra Four):** Creation of a persona or social mask to interact with others based on how we perceive our role in serving others and our self-acceptance. Expands beyond the realm of self-centered needs.
* **Creative Identity (Chakra Five):** Identification with our self-expression through creativity, commitments, and taking responsibility for what we say and produce.
* **Intellectual Identity (Chakra Six):** Identification with knowledge and understanding. Ability to think abstractly and make decisions based on logic and reason.
* **Spiritual Identity (Chakra Seven):** Identification with the highest aspects of consciousness, beyond the individual self. Connection to the universal spirit or divine.

**Identity as Clothing:** Metaphoric layers that cover the essential soul underneath. Necessary but problematic when confused for the whole self.

**Positive and Negative Chakra Identities:** Real parts of ourselves, yet not the whole. Can be liberating or imprisoning.

**Creative Identity Development:**
- Expands outward, contributing to larger system
- Identify with archetypal possibilities and inspirations
- Realization of personal contribution to the larger system
- Foundation: healthy ego, social confidence, compassion

**Chakra Six: Archetypal Identity**
- Expand into transpersonal identity
- Personal story as part of a larger story
- Carry pieces of archetypal stories (Mother Goddess, Father archetype)
- Universal understanding of self
- Self-reflection in larger system
- Consciously embrace evolution of archetypal symbols
- Contribution to larger archetypal causes

**Chakra Seven: Universal Identity**
- Expansion into universal identity
- Realization of magnificent scope of cosmos
- Transcendence of smaller identities
- Integration of individuality into larger field of the divine
- Buddhist maxim: "Thou Art That"
- Purpose of spiritual disciplines: break through bonding with smaller identities

### DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES
**Chakra Developmental Stages** according to William Shakespeare and Eastern Philosophy:

* **All the World's a Stage:** Each person goes through various developmental stages in life.
* **Seven Ages:** Chakras evolve sequentially, each completed stage supporting the healthy awakening of the next.

**Chakra One: Infancy (Mid-pregnancy to 12 months after birth)**

* **Body Formation:** Takes place during prenatal development and infancy.
* **Infant's Developmental Task:** To learn how to operate the body.
* **Focus on Survival:** Consciousness is focused internally, with little awareness of the outside world.
* **Trust vs. Mistrust (Erikson):** Infants develop a sense of trust or mistrust based on their experiences during this stage.
* **Foundation of Security:** Successfully progressing through this stage builds the foundation for security and self-preservation, forming the physical
identity.

**Chakra Two: Six Months to Approximately 2 Years**

- Comes into conscious attention around six months when visual acuity develops
- Infant becomes aware of things outside immediate range and experiences alertness
- Discovers separation from mother, leading to ambivalence and fear
- Characterized by conflict of separation vs. attachment
- First distinctions experienced as binary choices: good/bad, pleasure/pain, etc.
- Focused on formation of emotional identity for self-gratification
- Communication mainly through emotion

**Chakra Three: 18 Months to Approximately 4 Years**

- Period of attempted autonomy during "terrible twos" or willful stage
- Child has successfully "hatched" from mother and wants to experiment with volition
- Development of language allows for understanding of cause and effect, leading to impulse control and delayed gratification (If I eat vegetables, I'll get dessert)
- Unconscious instinctual states of lower chakras begin to come under conscious control
- Child is self-centered and focused on establishing a sense of personhood, power, and self-creation
- Important achievement: autonomy and will, balanced with the will of others
- Erikson refers to this stage as autonomy vs. shame and doubt
- Formation of personal ego identity, primarily focused on self-definition

**Chakra Four (Age 4-7):**

- Developed as child leaves egocentricity of third chakra
- Interests in relationships outside primary family ones
- Loving becomes more conscious and adapted
- Autonomy developed in third chakra forms foundation for relationships
- First model of relationships comes from family
- Learning how things relate to each other is dominant task
- Formation of social identity based on self-acceptance
- Successful resolution leads to direction and purpose (initiative vs. guilt)

**Chakra Five (Age 7-12):**

- Period of personal creativity and offering to the world
- Solid sense of self and desire to express energy
- Thinking operates on symbolic level, allowing for creativity and abstract thinking
- Formation of creative identity based on self-expression
- Resolution leads to sense of competence (industry vs. inferiority)

**Chakra Six (Adolescence):**

- Recognition and application of patterns in life decisions
- Emergence of formal operations stage and symbolic conception of the world
- Reexamining social identity and making it a conscious choice
- Dawning interest in spiritual matters and self-reflection
- Formation of archetypal identity

- New information filtered through developing worldview
- Search for meaning and asking questions about nature of life, universe, Self
- Formation of universal identity based on self-knowledge.

### INTERACTIVE DEVELOPMENT: THE CHAKRA SYSTEM AS A WHOLE
- Both ascending and descending energy currents play a role in development.
- Awareness of the body (Chakra one) allows differentiation and operation on it, leading to physical world interaction.
- Dawning of images (Chakra six) brings perception of the external world, otherness, and exploration (Chakra two).
- Language skills (Chakra five) enable exertion of will (Chakra three), conceptualization, and relationship development (Chakra four).
- Difficulties during any stage can impact the developing chakra and subsequent ones.
- Examples: Sense of power linked to meeting survival needs, heart ease with nurturance in first two chakras, communication with balanced ego and sense 
of love and acceptance.

**Figure 0.12:** Diagram representing the interaction between ascending and descending energy currents during development.

**Adult Development: The Process of Individuation**

- Chakra development in adulthood is conscious, requiring personal desire to occur.
- Some people remain in dependency and powerlessness, never experiencing adult chakra development or higher self potential.
- For those seeking growth, here's a description of the second round of chakra evolution.

**Individuation**

- Becoming a single, homogeneous being.
- Embracing unique inner qualities = "self-realization" (C.G. Jung).

**Early Adulthood: Chakra Stages Begin Again**

- The second round of development is less clearly defined due to individual variations.
- Some life stages overlap or occur in different orders, such as career, family, spirituality, etc.

**Guideline for Chakra Development in Adulthood (General)**

1. Leaving home: Establishing independence (early adulthood).
2. Awareness of body and emotions: Connection to self and others (Chakras one through four).
3. Exploring relationships: Building healthy, balanced relationships (Chakra four and beyond).
4. Personal power: Developing inner strength and autonomy (Chakra three and above).
5. Self-expression: Creative exploration of personal potential (Chakra five and beyond).
6. Transcendence: Connecting to a greater purpose or spirituality (Chakras six through eight).

### BASIC ISSUES OF THE FIRST CHAKRA

**First Chakra (Muladhara)**:
- Foundation of the temple and the entire chakra system
- Situated at the base of the spine
- Anchors the temple of the body to the earth
- Provides stability, firmness, and consistency
- Defines boundaries and determines shape and structure of the body
- Connection to survival instincts

**The Foundation of the Temple** (Muladhara):
- Resting upon the earth as a universal ground
- Build the foundation for the temple of the body
- Anchor for the Rainbow Bridge
- Damage to this chakra affects all others above

**Basic Issues**:
- Survival: the original challenge to being alive and the primary instinct
- Assuring survival allows consciousness to engage in other activities
- Threatens consciousness dominates all functions when activated
- Can lead to chronic stress, anxiety, and health problems
- Common in those raised in violent or impoverished environments

**Effects of Damage**:
- Plagued with issues of survival: health, money, housing, job problems
- Elusive sense of safety and security
- Rupture between consciousness and the core of being
- Disconnected from natural instincts and environment

**Instinct to Survive**:
- Unavoidable and fundamental instinct
- Archaic baseline maintenance program for physical existence
- Dominates all functions when threatened
- Keep body in hyperstimulated readiness with stress hormones
- Common in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

**Reclaiming the First Chakra**:
- Living harmoniously with survival instincts without being unconsciously ruled by them.

### THE DEMON OF FEAR

* Fear arises when sacred gets scrambled and survival is threatened
* Heightens awareness, floods body with natural chemicals (adrenalin) for action
* Focuses attention outward and upward to chakras of perception and mental activity
* Results in hypervigilance, restlessness, anxiety, and inability to relax or settle
* Can stem from environment of danger or deprivation during childhood
* Creates a constant state of stress, which may lead to health issues like high blood pressure, heart trouble, stomach troubles, immune system depletion, weak adrenal glands, insomnia, or chronic fatigue
* Fear engages survival instincts and wakes us up but can become constant and hinder appropriate response
* Can be understood and released through acknowledgment of origins, allowing body to express responses, and developing resources for effective future encounters

**Fear as a Sacred Adversary:**

* Fear exists as an ally teaching self-preservation and the importance of taking care of ourselves
* Both fear and faith have similar causes: beliefs that govern behavior and influence feelings
* Replacing unreasonable fear with reasonable faith acts as a natural antidote to the first chakra demon

**Reclaiming Our Roots (Muladhara Chakra):**

* Sanskrit name for base chakra: "root support"
* Represents our connection to our bodies, physical world, earth, ancestors, family, and personal history
* Acknowledging past and examining it helps create a solid foundation
* Corresponds to the element earth and human dependence on energy from the planet
* Bringing muladhara to consciousness connects us to the commonality of the collective unconscious and anchors us into the earth
* Groundedness channels flow of excitement from ourselves to the environment and vice versa.

### GROUNDING

**Grounding and the First Chakra:**

* A healthy first chakra enables grounding, which is essential for basic aliveness and well-being.
* Grounding connects us to our body and environment, providing strength and stability.
* Physically, grounding occurs through the legs and feet, allowing energy to flow up from the base of the body.
* Being grounded brings consciousness into the body and aids in forming healthy boundaries.
* Spiritual growth requires embracing our natural tendencies rather than denying them through ascetic practices.

**Effects of Grounding:**

* Presence, focus, and dynamic energy
* Connection to emotional-electrical currents and physical-psychic processes
* Confident and contained demeanor

**Consequences of Ungroundedness:**

* Loss of stability and center
* Difficulty containing and holding boundaries
* Inability to mature and transform

**Nourishment and the First Chakra:**

* Adequate nourishment is necessary for physical survival.
* Lack of support or nourishment leads to a feeling of collapse.
* Neglecting one's right to be here can manifest as eating disorders or abandonment issues.

**Manifestation and Prosperity:**

* Grounding, connection with the body, self-nourishment, and self-preservation contribute to prosperity.
* Meeting basic survival needs provides security, stability, and independence.
* Manifestation requires focusing on specific goals and accepting limitations.

**Limitation and Acceptance:**

* Boundaries create necessary limitations for manifestation and growth.
* Accepting and cooperating with limitations allows energy to build and expand to higher levels.
* Rebelling against limitations keeps us in survival mode and unable to transcend them.

### TRAUMAS AND ABUSES

**Traumas and Abuses Impacting the First Chakra:**

* Anything threatening survival in early life can affect first chakra formation.
* Younger children are more vulnerable to these threats.
* A smooth first year creates a solid foundation for later resilience.
* Trauma forces a child into fear and helplessness, blocking the downward energy flow.
* The mind-body connection is crucial for recovery.

**Birth Trauma:**

* Our first survival experience; separation from mother after birth is traumatic.
* Technological birth practices shock our ancient nervous systems.
* Breastfeeding and postnatal contact are important for bonding.
* Birth traumas can cause further difficulties and health issues.
* A proper grounding during infancy leads to calmness and positive relationships.

**Impact of Birth Trauma:**

* Infants may cry excessively, have health problems, and hinder parent-child bonding.
* Adults who experienced traumatic births might view life as surreal and accept isolation.
* Lack of safety and bonding in infancy can result in a vague sense of something missing from life.

**Impact of Incubator Babies:**

* Deprived of mother's touching and suckling.
* Seeing loving faces through glass without being touched is disembodied.
* Adults who were incubator babies might have trouble with relationships and understanding the importance of safety and bonding.

**Abandonment:**
- Directly impacts survival, both physically and emotionally
- Physical abandonment: children in institutions suffer from marasmus, a wasting disease due to lack of touch
- Emotional abandonment: feelings of unwantedness and fear
- Can be subtle or blatant, longer separations create profound insecurity
- Adopted children experience abandonment by birth parents
- Threatens survival and elicits fear, may inhibit appropriate responses to common situations

- Emotional: fear, insecurity, low self-esteem, mistrust of others
- Psychological: excessive clinging to security, inability to change

**Neglect:**
- Subtler form of abandonment
- Intermittent, instability leads to mistrust and further alienation
- Impacts third chakra (self-esteem) and fourth chakra (right to be loved)
- Result in self-neglect, shame, eating disorders, or digestive difficulties

**Feeding Difficulties:**
- Malnourishment or hostile eating situations affect ability to nourish oneself
- Emotional state of mother during feeding and inherited attitudes about food impact vital survival function
- Can result in trust issues, eating disorders, or stagnant energy due to being a closed system.

**Enemas and First Chakra Trauma:**
- Repeated use of enemas can be traumatic to the first chakra, leading to trust issues and a fractured sense of solidity (John Bradshaw)
- Can result in difficulties with boundaries, autonomy, and an inability or excessive need to hold and contain (third chakra issue)
- May have sexual overtones in some cases
- Destroys the child's trust and sense of control over their body
- Energy is pulled upward towards the head, leading to issues with feelings and self-esteem (second and third chakras)

**Physical Abuse:**
- Causes pain and teaches dissociation from bodily sensations
- May lead to addictive stress response and a need for crisis in order to feel alive
- Impacts all chakras, with difficulties in surrendering to feelings (second), power dynamics and self-esteem (third), relationships (fourth), communication (fifth), clear seeing (sixth), and clear thinking (seventh)
- Physically harms the body, leading to first chakra issues
- Creates a profound betrayal of trust
- May result in excessive or deficient coping strategies, such as dissociation or obsession with the body
- Fragmenting effect on the nervous system and natural flow of experience
- Can lead to physical injuries and damage
- Constantly dangerous environment, leading to fear and a constant companion, creating future crisis situations to stimulate a familiar sense of aliveness.

### ACCIDENTS, SURGERIES, ILLNESSES

**Accidents, Surgeries, and Illnesses:**
- James had a series of freak accidents starting at age 4, including being hit by a car, fracturing his skull, appendicitis, and being attacked by a mugger
- These events traumatized his nervous system and led to post-traumatic stress symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating and containing energy
- Surgeries, illnesses, and accidents can have long-term emotional effects, including unconscious fears, difficulty sleeping, changes in eating habits, nervousness, and difficulty concentrating

### Effects of Trauma
- Impact of accidents may leave unidentified marks in the body as post-traumatic stress symptoms
- These symptoms may include energetic fragmentation and difficulty with containment, focus, grounding, and first chakra issues

**Inherited Trauma:**
- Lucy's sister died in the crib when she was two years old, leading to her parents doting on her out of fear that she might also die
- Lucy absorbed her parents' unconscious fear and had frequent health problems and insecurities throughout her life
- Parents with war trauma, poverty issues, racial persecution, holocaust survival, loss of a previous child, or unresolved survival issues may pass their fears onto their children through attitudes and beliefs about the world's danger.

**Impact on First Chakra:**
- Trauma can contaminate the underlying ground of being with an unidentified layer of fear and distrust that eventually becomes part of the bodily experience
- This can lead to first chakra issues, such as difficulty with containment, focus, grounding, and other first chakra issues.

**Poor Boundaries and Embodiment:**
- Interfering with boundary formation or dissolution can hinder self-development (Stanley Keleman)
- Clients without proper nurturing, continuity, and safety may struggle with boundaries (example of a client who grew up in an orphanage)
- Lack of boundaries can lead to legal issues, such as child molesting charges
- The world will provide boundaries if we don't establish our own (rejection, jail, illness)
- Pairing up with people with overly rigid boundaries is also a possibility

**Effects of Poor Boundaries:**
- Fear to set appropriate limits due to unmet lower chakra needs
- Unable to experience satisfaction of "enough" due to past denial of merging and contact
- Inability to form boundaries when serving family's survival needs in childhood
- Disembodiment: splitting into a disconnected spirit and body (Alexander Lowen)

**Implications:**
- If lower chakra needs are not met, we may be afraid to set limits and establish boundaries
- Proper grounding and satisfaction of our basic needs enable us to set healthy boundaries
- Lack of awareness of bodily feelings and attitudes can lead to a disconnected sense of self.

**Upper Chakra Dominance** and First Chakra Damage:
- Experiences threatening survival lead to upward energy movement, cutting off bodily sensations and inhibiting the downward current.
- A person may be physically numb and neglect basic needs like eating and resting, resulting in frequent illnesses and lack of emotion awareness.
- Hypervigilant to external messages, searching for connection or danger, creating a mind-body split.
- Ground is often overlooked or invisible, leading to confusion and difficulty addressing the root issue.

**Neurotic, Schizoid, and Schizophrenic Egos:**
- **Neurotic ego:** Dominates the body, seeing it as an object to be controlled.
- **Schizoid ego:** Denies the body, disregarding its needs and sensations.
- **Schizophrenic ego:** Dissociates from the body, leading to alienation and objectification.

**Impact of First Chakra Damage on Other Chakras:**
- Sexuality: Affected due to experience of the body and connection.
- Personal power: Weakened without ground to stand on.
- Relationships: Adversely affected by lack of boundaries and constant reassurance.
- Communication: Blocked or excessive, disconnected from feeling.
- Upper chakras: Intensified with imagination and intellect as a defense against feeling; can lead to confusion, vagueness, or feeling of going crazy.

**Objectifying the Body:**
- Person may see their body as an alien entity, object, or thing.
- Women often view their bodies in this way due to societal conditioning.
- Resulting in control and maintenance focus rather than embracing the body as a living, dynamic statement of self.

**Additional Chakra Imbalances:**
- Second chakra: Sexuality affected by lack of connection with the body.
- Third chakra: Personal power weakened without ground.
- Fourth chakra: Relationships adversely affected, communication may be blocked or excessive.
- Fifth chakra: Communication and expression may be affected, leading to confusion or vagueness.
- Sixth chakra: Intensification of intellect as a defense against feeling.
- Seventh chakra: Disconnection from the body and ground, potentially leading to feelings of going crazy.

**Grounding and Embodying Consciousness:**
- Addressing first chakra damage by building a downward current and developing a solid foundation (ground).
- Grounding practices like mindfulness meditation, yoga, or grounding exercises can be helpful.
- Embracing the body as a living, dynamic statement of self rather than an object to be controlled.

### CHARACTER STRUCTURE THE SCHIZOID: CREATIVE AND INTELLIGENT
- An emergency mechanism for coping with danger to life and sanity
- High degree of intelligence, creativity, and interest in spiritual matters
- Develops early in life due to lack of sense of safety or wanting from mother
- Marked by energetic statement of withdrawal from life

**The Unwanted Child**

- Developed when mother's emotions are transmitted to the child in womb
- Mother's fear, anger, or unwillingness to be pregnant impacts fetus
- Lack of freedom, safety, and sense of being wanted leads to contraction as a normal way of being

**Characteristics of Schizoid/Creative**

- Ignoring signals of hunger, thirst, or fatigue
- Difficulty experiencing body as whole organism
- Blocked at throat, constantly clearing it while speaking

- Upper chakras highly developed, lower chakras have little energy
- Out of touch with body, lack of sexual partners and close friends
- Energetic process is fragmented, preferring to stay in realm of conversation
- Fear-based, living in fear and unable to handle too much charge or excitement

**Healing Schizoid/Creative Character Structure**

- Assignments in self-care: eating, sleeping, massage, baths
- Reclaim body piece by piece through drawing, movement, and boundary work
- Break habit of contraction with gentle physical exploration
- Gradually trust more people, open up, value self, and participate in life.

### EXCESS AND DEFICIENCY

- Determining excess or deficiency in a chakra is necessary before using exercises
- An excessive chakra benefits from relaxing or discharging exercises, while a deficient one benefits from stimulating or charging exercises

**Concept of Charge:**
- Charge is a bioenergetic term for the body's basic excitement
- It is felt during intense emotional states such as anger, excitement, love, fear, and spiritual connection
- Issues from childhood can hold positive or negative charge
- Charge can be invoked through grounding exercises, increased breathing, fantasy, visualization, talking about charged material, or experiencing truth

**Characteristics of Charge:**
- Can be felt as intensity, enthusiasm, or heightened awareness
- Positive experiences also hold charge and can give a sense of well-being
- Increasing charge increases body's aliveness and awareness

**Depression and Undercharge:**
- Depression is a state of undercharge, lack of excitement or enthusiasm
- Increasing charge can help increase sense of well-being for those who are depressed or have weak bodies

**Negative Effects of Charge:**
- Not all charge is pleasurable; rigidity and chronic muscular tension defend against charge
- Overcharging the body can lead to anxiety, restlessness, fear, or feeling out of control
- Excessive charge is experienced as stress

**Images and Truth:**
- Dream images may hold a lot of charge and discussing them can spontaneously arise in the body as one discusses his dream
- Truth also has a charge, especially when it has been previously hidden.

**Deficiencies in the First Chakra:**

* A contracted and vacant first chakra may be recognizable by a person's physical posture and movements
* Contraction can pull energy upward, backward, or downward, leading to various symptoms
	+ Upward contraction: empty and vacant feeling, out of touch with feelings in the area
	+ Backward contraction: difficulty concentrating, restlessness, shifting position constantly
	+ Downward contraction: poor muscle tone, circulation, color, boundary formation, undernourished and undercharged
* A deficient first chakra may result from neglect or rejection during developmental stages, leading to insufficient energy for a solid foundation
* People with deficient first chakras respond well to grounding exercises and boundary work

**Excesses in the First Chakra:**

* An excessive first chakra feels heavy and solid, but with a sluggish and massive feeling
* The body may be large and dense, with excess weight distributed around the hips, thighs, and buttocks
* Movements are infrequent, eyes defensive, and head held steady
* People with excessive first chakras like routine, security, and possessions, and may appear cynical about spiritual subjects
* Excessive first chakra types need to discharge, let go, and shift from excessive stability to movement and flow through physical activities such as dancing, walking, swimming, or stretching

**Balance in the First Chakra:**

* A balanced first chakra is both solidly grounded and dynamically alive
* There is a sense of form without rigidity, bodily comfort, and healthy distribution of energy throughout
* Integrating excessive and deficient strategies involves bringing extremes back toward a common center, anchored in the physical body

**Assessing Your History:**

* Developmental life experiences can reveal information about a chakra's structure
* Neglect or rejection usually leads to deficiencies, while stressful situations and challenges result in excesses
* Persistent problems can be sorted into problems of excess or deficiency by comparing statements with the chart at the beginning of the chapter.

### RESTORING THE LOTUS HEALING THE FIRST CHAKRA

### AFFIRM THE PHYSICAL

**First Chakra:**
- Represents our physical reality
- Damage leads to a damaged relationship with the physical world
- Healing through creating a new relationship with the body, earth, and surroundings
- Affirming and pleasurable experiences are crucial for Schizoid structure with deficient first chakra
- Regular massage and physical exercise essential
- Massage breaks down contracted body armor and provides nurturing experience
- Exercise pumps energy through body and develops strength
- Body-ego is energized by the power of Dynamic Ground
- Entire physical being is electrically charged, making any bodily part a potential seat of somatic ecstasy

**Working with Bodily Experience:**
- Encourage clients to connect feelings with physical sensations
- Identify physical responses to emotions (e.g., butterflies in stomach, shallow breathing)
- Deepen feelings by intensifying physical response or creating an opposite reaction
- Help clients notice body numbness through exaggerating physical sensations
- Lessen negative feelings through opposite movements and grounding techniques

**Importance of Grounding:**
- Necessary for emotional and physical healing
- Encourages confrontation, saying no, getting angry, or defending

- Essential in maintaining a grounded position during emotional processing
- Prevents overwhelming the system with cathartic release if trauma is severe

**Interdependence of Emotional and Physical Structures:**

- Both sides must be worked simultaneously, but focus on the physical for this text.

### WORK ON THE FEET

**Grounding Work with the Feet**

* Connects us to the ground and grounding through feet and legs
* Two types: working directly on feet or standing on them

**Directly Working on the Feet:**

* Foot massage, flexing, arching, kicking, pushing
* Using tools like tennis balls or footsie rollers
* Helps open up muscles and releases tension

**Standing on the Feet:**

* Maintains deeper energetic connection to the body
* Essential for people with grounding problems
* Encourages greater presence in therapy sessions

**Simple Grounding Techniques while Sitting:**

* Keeping feet on the ground, preferably barefoot
* Pressing into feet reaffirms and strengthens grounding connection

**Working Psychologically while Standing:**

* Increases body's energy
* Allows greater assertiveness, overcomes passivity
* Supports independence and manifests autonomy

**Attention to Client's Feet:**

* Feeling feet holding up body's weight
* Texture of floor beneath
* Awareness of feet often increases, leading to greater grounding

**Body Postures:**

* Conscious: held in stomach, lifted shoulders and chest, straight spine
* Unconscious: slumping, tightening, standing habitually on one leg

**Client's Experience with Grounding:**

* Jittery or secure?
* Focus of tension or relaxation?
* Emotional responses (fear, excitement, sadness)?
* Sensations in the body and when they started
* Inviting deeper experience through statements and questions

**Body Postures and Energy Flow:**

* Locking knees cuts down on energetic connection between legs and ground, deadens bodily sensations
* Passive weight vs. alertness posture
* Dead weight: collapses chest, pushes belly forward, head falls downward, lessens breathing
* Alertness posture: holds knees slightly bent, keeps center of gravity low

**Philosophical Implications:**

* Having a client stand on their feet embodies concepts like autonomy, taking a stand, having a leg to stand on, etc.
* It's not so much the meaning of life we seek but our aliveness

### GROUNDING EXERCISE

**Grounding Exercise:**
- Client stands with feet shoulder width apart, toes slightly inward, knees slightly bent
- Ask client to push into their feet as if trying to part the floorboards for leg solidity
- Establish basic position and ask client to bend and straighten knees slowly while maintaining contact with the ground
- Trembling in the legs is a sign of new energy coming into the body
- Energy can be used to enliven deadened parts or passed upward to the rest of the body
- Increased contact with the ground builds up charge, which can lead to anxiety

**Dealing with Anxiety:**
- Observe client's physical and emotional states
- Curtail anxiety by slowing down or stopping the exercise, kicking legs in the air, or sitting in a chair
- Process anxiety by working through the material it illuminates
- Allow client to express feelings and find solid contact with someone

**Benefits of Grounding:**
- Increases energy flow in the body
- Builds up charge
- Helps resolve issues related to first chakra (jobs, housing, physical ailments)

**Observations and Dialogue:**
- Observe client's physical and emotional states during exercise
- Keep in touch with client through constant dialog to determine if they can handle pushing deeper into the issue

**Case Study:**
- Sally experienced anxiety during her first grounding experience due to confusion about her instinctual response to needing someone when they were not there
- Anxiety was resolved by allowing her to express feelings and find solid contact with someone, resulting in a feeling of calm.

### REGRESSIVE TECHNIQUES

**Regressive Techniques:**
- Preambulatory stages of life require certain techniques for first chakra work
- Rebirthing techniques involve laying down and simulate womb and birth experience
- Holotropic breath work releases deep tensions held in the body
- Not suitable for clients with serious trauma or unknown histories

**Early Childhood Stages Techniques:**

### EMOTIONS

**Emotions:**
- Source of becoming conscious (Jung)
- Instinctual reactions to sensory data
- Unconscious reaction to information from senses
- Organize our feelings and give meaning to experiences
- Can arise from depths of psyche without conscious control
- Have a spiritual function as language of the soul
- Building blocks of experience, give meaning and integrates felt sense
- Pervasive feelings initiate quest for change and transformation
- Help unravel story of soul's journey
- Subconscious organizations of impulses to move away from harm and toward pleasure
- Difficult to feel emotions without some kind of movement

**Needs:**
- Necessities, not idle longings
- Basic requirements for healthy functioning
- Nonnegotiable bottom line
- Often shamed in childhood, leading to disowning needs
- Can keep ourselves deprived and depleted by disowning needs
- Reclaiming needs allows us to take responsibility for own fulfillment

**Desire:**
- Spiritual/emotional impulse inspiring movement towards something greater
- Soul's longing to move forward
- Object of desire may not be necessary, but feeling of desire is essential
- Desire fuels will and action
- Can lead to frustration and growth
- Combination of sensation and feeling
- Essential for developing energy and power
- Thrusting forward that leads us to action
- Staying in touch with feelings allows us to know soul's desire

**Shadow:**
- Unacknowledged aspects of personality, including desires and emotions
- Can sabotage will by fighting against it
- Denying shadow can lead to unhealthy repression or projection of unwanted traits onto others.

### THE SHADOW

**C.G. Jung's Perspective on Enlightenment and the Second Chakra:**
- Enlightenment is achieved by making the darkness conscious, not by focusing on figures of light.
- The second chakra represents duality and polarity, and its task in adult development is to integrate previously polarized aspects of personality into an indivisible whole.
- One essential step is reclaiming the shadow.

**The Shadow:**
- Repressed instinctual energies that are locked away in the unconscious.
- They do not die but are no longer part of conscious awareness and are enacted unconsciously.
- Keeping the shadow repressed requires a great deal of energy and robs us of grace and power.
- It sabotages our work, relationships, and health.
- We attract those who embody our rejected shadow in our lives.
- Judgment arises out of resonance between the rejected self and behavior of others to remove stimuli that might awaken our shadow.

**Impact of Repressing the Shadow:**
- Cut off from our wholeness and inner child's innocence and spontaneity.
- Projected onto others, leading to intense criticism and judgment.
- Compels us to attract individuals who embody our rejected aspects.
- Causes an unhealthy guilt that rejects our worth as human beings.

**Reclaiming the Shadow:**
- Bringing instinctual energies into consciousness instead of repressing them.
- Eliminates judgment and restores wholeness.
- Allows us to acknowledge and accept rejected aspects of ourselves.
- Prevents the shadow from becoming demonic or taking over our conscious self.

**Examples:**
- Repressed sexuality: seeing others' behavior as shameless, while remaining virtuous.
- Suppression of emotions: intolerance for needy and expressive individuals.

**Guilt and the Second Chakra:**
- Guilt is referred to as the demon of the second chakra because it curtails free movement and takes pleasure out of experiences.
- Feeling guilty prevents satisfaction and can lead to compulsive activities.
- Guilt keeps the shadow, our hidden desires and instincts, caged in the unconscious realm.
- Guilt polarizes the personality, dividing light against dark, good against bad.
- A polarized personality is characterized by either-or thinking with no room for ambiguity or subtle nuances.
- Morals taught in black-and-white terms to young children can lead to immature cognitive processes and either-or thinking.
- Feeling trapped in either-or thinking can thwart the movement aspect of the second chakra.

**Fuzzy Logic and Ambiguity:**
- Fuzzy logic is being introduced into computers to make decisions based on approximations between polarities instead of clear black-and-white choices.
- Ambiguity has a destabilizing effect, making it hard for some people to hold the tension between opposites and find new standpoints.

**Healthy vs. Toxic Guilt:**
- Guilt can be a healthy feeling that allows us to examine our behavior and make necessary changes.
- Excessive, habitual, internalized, and toxic guilt dominates the free flow of movement and full sensate experience of life.

**Effects of Guilt on the Second Chakra:**
- Guilt can thwart the movement aspect of the second chakra by taking pleasure out of experiences and creating paralysis.
- Developing the ability to feel emotions fully allows us to discern subtle nuances between polarities and make better decisions.
- Healthy guilt acts as a guide, while toxic guilt dominates and binds us.

### SEXUALITY

**Sexuality:**
- Ultimate expression of issues associated with second chakra
- Incorporation of Eros, the connecting force of attraction
- Expresses movement, sensation, pleasure, desire, emotions, polarity
- Unites opposites, transcends isolation, forms foundation for next chakra level (power)
- Brings us into contact with others, grounds for growth
- Misunderstood in modern culture

**Eros:**
- Ancient god, connecting force that unites and delights
- Hindu mythology: originator of all gods, binding power of allurement
- Denial can lead to destructive activities
- Unity of culture and nature, work and love, morality and sexuality
- Embracing Eros: capacity for surrender, ability to flow with instinctual/emotional body
- Ecstatic expression of life force in lower chakras

**Effects of Mismanaged Sexuality:**
- Denial can pull things apart, leads to destructive activities
- Guilt as antidote to pleasure and self-esteem, locks essential gateway to pleasure and transformation
- Rejection of sexuality sends it to shadow, takes on demonic form (dissociation and perpetration)
- Essential for reclaiming second chakra, honoring Eros in every aspect of life

**Balanced Second Chakra Characteristics:**
- Capacity for sexual satisfaction and pleasure
- Comfort with intimacy
- Ability to accept movement and change gracefully
- Steadiness and clarity in emotional states
- Nurturing self and others while maintaining healthy boundaries
- Healthy expression of intimacy, pleasure, and joy
- Qualifications for healthy sexuality to be decided by individuals

**Development during Infancy:**

* Baby learns to string together sensations, actions, and reactions into organized sense of self between ages 9-18 months

**Importance of Emotional Literacy**
- Emotions are the first language of the child
- Effective mirroring and positive response help child understand emotions
- Understanding emotions allows for more mature expression
- Emotional literacy promotes connection and human experience.

**Emotional Enmeshment:**
- Children are not entirely belong to their parents; they develop their own identity (Gibran)
- **Second Chakra Development:**
  - Begins with mother-child fusion, ends with autonomy

- Forms of sexual abuse: slapping or punishing children for exploring their genitals, pushing sexuality onto unwilling or developmentally inappropriate children, exhibitionism, voyeurism, exposure to pornography, unwanted physical affection, age-inappropriate language, invasion of privacy, and sexual engagement with a child
- Can be emotionally numbing, leading to addictions, eating disorders, phobias, sexual dysfunction, guilt, shame, depression, hostility, dependency, sleep disorders, psychosomatic disorders, repressed memories, intrusive memories, confusion between pleasure and pain, and emotional betrayal
- Difficulty with boundaries may result in further traumas and high incidence of subsequent abuse
- Effects can be lifelong and impact immune system function

**Impact on Chakras:**

- Strong foundations in lower chakras aid recovery process.

**Abortion:**
- Abortion has emotional consequences for women, including moral struggle, emotional turmoil, guilt, fear, grief, and loss.
- It interrupts the natural process of pregnancy and causes physical trauma to second chakra organs.
- Women should treat themselves with tenderness after an abortion, similar to how they would treat a rape victim.
- Dialogue or ritual around the possible spirit of the child is important, as well as dialoguing with the body before, during, and after the procedure.
- Having support from friends and writing in a journal can help in healing.
- Political climate around abortion can add to the pain and trauma for women, instead of love and support they need.

**Effects of Abuses on Second Chakra:**
- The wounds to the second chakra are profound due to societal confusion around sexuality and pleasure, mechanization, and disconnection between mind and body and self and environment.
- Blocked development of the second chakra severs internal and external connections.
- Lack of tactile stimulation and nurturing leads to fragmentation, isolation, and disconnection from feelings and others.
- Denial of expression through movement results in rigidity, requiring great energy and leading to judgmental behavior.

**General Effects of Abuses:**
- In a world that denies pleasure and sensate experiences, we become out of touch with our bodies and feelings.
- Lack of empathy and compassion results from disconnection from self and others.
- Rigidity and lack of flexibility hinder new ideas and possibilities, leading to judgmental behavior.

### THAWING THE ICE— RESTORING THE FREE FLOW OF MOVEMENT

**Thawing the Ice:** A process of restoring the free flow of movement and emotion in individuals with traumatic experiences.

**Ray's Story:**
- Complained of recurrent neck pain, tried various methods without success
- Held body rigidly, energy contracted
- Trauma response: inhibited fight or flight leading to frozen response

**Trauma and the Freezing Response:**
- Occurs when an individual adapts to threat but cannot adapt again or return to pre-threat functioning
- Results in partial checkout from body and dissociation from painful sensations
- Peter Levine's description: ongoing activation with inhibition, leading to frozen intensity (tonic immobility)
- Natural response throughout the animal kingdom for survival against predators

**Bioenergetic Work:**
- Began favorably with Ray, releasing trapped energy through movement
- Gradually integrated historical material and emotions into movements
- Established boundaries and power to work more deeply on emotional content

**The Freezing Response and Thawing:**
- Increased energy flow in preparation for fight or flight during trauma
- Repeated trauma forces living in contradiction of activation and inhibition
- Frozen response produces immobility, rigidity, and uncoordinated movements
- Thawing involves freeing up body's natural movement slowly and carefully
- Anchoring energy to ground it and prevent overwhelming nervous system
- Small pieces of traumatic experience integrated gradually (titration)

**The Impact of Trauma:**
- Universal imprint left by trauma: guilt
- Individual may feel responsible for causing the trauma regardless of circumstances.

**Additional Notes:**
- Peter Levine's book, "Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma through the Body" provides a more detailed description of the process.

### WORKING THROUGH GUILT

**Working Through Guilt:**

* Examining past influences:
  + Child with poor academic performance: acknowledge volatile family situations hindering focus on studies.
  + Person feeling needy: determine if needs were met in the past.
* Acknowledging past forces:
  + Allows for change in present behavior.
  + Does not mean avoiding responsibility, but understanding context.

**Steps to Move Through Guilt:**
1. **Put the guilty behavior in context:** Identify external factors acting on you at the time.
2. **Examine motives and underlying needs:** Understand what you were trying to satisfy or accomplish.
3. **Identify potential influences from upbringing:** Consider how your behavior was modeled for you.
4. **Address underlying needs:** Seek ways to directly fulfill those needs in a healthy manner.
5. **Make amends for any harm caused:** Find ways to make things right, or address the situation in a more global way.
6. **Plan new behavior:** Set goals for healthier actions moving forward.
7. **Forgive yourself and move on:** Allow yourself to let go of guilt and focus on growth.

**Healthy Guilt:**

* Emotional core of conscience: results from behaving against beliefs and values.
* Questions to examine limiting belief systems:
  + What belief system says certain behaviors are wrong (e.g., sex, self-care)?
  + Where did you learn it?
  + Who does the belief serve?
  + What are the effects of those values on your life and relationships?
  + What is your own belief, and what evidence supports it?
  + What are the results of following that belief system?
  + Is harm caused to yourself or others?
  + Seek support for actions you believe in.

- When emotions are excessive, shift awareness to body sensations
- Consciously bringing attention inward softens emotions, brings richer information and connection.

**Emotional Release:**
- Goal of therapy to facilitate emotional release for healing and transformation
- Catharsis can bring profound healing but not always the case
- Emotional release involves body and movement, releasing energy vortex of emotion
- Not enough for head to acknowledge emotions without bodily expression and movement
- Can be overwhelming if trauma is severe or emotional patterns are deeply ingrained
- Short-term relief without cognitive integration can lead to seeking repeated release
- Emotional release completes actions that have been interrupted, makes energy available for new orientation

**Containment:**
- Alternative to emotional release when ground is not stable or safety and containment are needed
- Learning to embrace feelings bodily and let them unfold within containing body
- Prevent disintegration and retraumatization from severe past traumas
- Balance for excessive second chakra, prevent addictive behaviors and understand motivation
- Containment invites creation of alternative paths for energy expression
- Not denying or negating experiences but consciously focusing on emotional process and where it is trying to go

**Emotional Release Pros:**

* Fascinated by others' triumphs and struggles for control

**Questions about Power**

* What is power? Where does it come from?
* How do we use it? Avoid its duality?
* Empowerment without diminishing others?
* Society of victims and controllers: obedience, cooperation with larger structures

**Concepts of Power**

* "Power-over" based on struggle and opposition between dualities
* Found with guns and money, dominion to rule

* Struggle becomes focus of life force
* Winning inner battles leads to fragmentation
* Reclaiming power: transformation, inspiration, empowerment

### ENERGY AND ACTIVITY

**Energy and Activity**
- Grounding is essential for converting energy into action
- Energy builds up and needs reorganization, expression, and discharge
- Increased excitation leads to urge to organize feelings into action

**Natural Expression of Energy**
- Expression of energy is through activity
- Activity engages us with surroundings, teaches about world and self
- Can result in delight or disaster

**Maturity and Personal Responsibility**
- As we mature, choose which impulses to act upon and control

### AUTONOMY

**Autonomy and Chakras:**

* Progression from lower to higher chakras: individuality to universality
* Lower gears (first three chakras): grounded, engaged, motivated, active, preserve individual self
* Upper chakras: connect to universal through communication, vision, understanding
* Heart chakra: individual and universal meet in perfect balance

**Importance of Autonomy:**

* Firm grasp of self essential for love and universal consciousness
* Overcoming the vastness of the universal without a solid sense of self can lead to loss of identity
* New Age and spiritual movement often overlook personal ego and autonomy
* Essential step for obtaining universal consciousness: letting go of attachment and transcending smallness of ego
* Autonomous individuals retain their individuality, follow own growth, and come together by choice
* Balanced relationships allow separation and freedom
* Autonomy essential for personal responsibility

**Effects of Lack of Autonomy:**

* Loss of identity and sense of self
* Overwhelmed by vastness of upper chakras
* Blaming others for problems instead of taking responsibility
* Enmeshed relationships with overreliance on partners for autonomy
* Passive and irresponsible behavior
* Waiting for others to change instead of taking action

**Grounding Exercises:**

* Simple grounding exercises can help reconnect individuals to themselves
* Reconstruction takes time and effort
* Grounding in autonomy allows for appropriate responsibility and power.

### INDIVIDUATION

**Individuation:** A process of personal growth and self-realization described by Carl Jung. It is a journey towards wholeness and awakening, integrating previously undeveloped aspects of oneself into a comprehensive Self.

* Journey towards realization and embracing the larger world of the personal and collective unconscious
* Awakens from small world to individuate and embrace unique, divine individuality
* Cannot be fully grasped as it is part of the mystery of transformation

**Third Chakra and Individuation:**

* Begins at third chakra, where ego awakens and differentiates from outer expectations
* Overcoming unconscious habits defined by others
* Daring to be unique and risking disapproval for personal truth
* Unfolding of unique destiny and unfolding of the soul
* Prevents changing the world if not individuated from societal expectations
* Power cannot be truly claimed without willingness to individuate

**Jung's Concept of Individuation:**

* Parallels adult development process through chakras
* Begins in third chakra with birth of psychic autonomy
* Many people do not awaken this chakra, remaining less differentiated in lower chakras
* Damage to or lack of completion in lower chakras keeps us from maturing and true psychic freedom.

### EGO IDENTITY

**Ego Identity:**
- Formation of an autonomous new identity beyond physical body and emotional experience
- Marks the birth of the ego as a conscious, self-determining separate entity

**Freud's Concept of Ego:**
- One of three major components of personality
- Mediates between id (instinctual drives) and superego (consciousness that controls these drives)
- Manages division between conscious and unconscious, interior and exterior
- Organizes instinctual energies and regulates their flow

**Jung's Concept of Ego:**
- Represents conscious element of the Self
- Facilitates interaction between inner and outer experience
- Acts as an operating principle

**Pierrakos' Concept of Ego:**

- Acts as a foundation for personal development

**The Importance of Ego:**
- Grounded self and individualized roots of consciousness
- Balances energy in the system and maintains homeostasis
- Necessary to anchor growth beyond the realms of the ego (individuation)

**Transcending the Ego:**
- Not a limiting or false concept, but a necessary foundation for growth
- Should not confine us at all times, but serve as an anchor for experience

**Love and Will in Modern Times:**
- Once seen as answers to life's problems
- Now considered the source of problems due to excessive focus on them

### WILL

**Chakra Therapy Session:** A woman in a therapy group volunteered to work on third chakra issues but lacked initiative.

**Problem of External Dependence:**
- She looked outside herself for direction instead of questioning her own needs and desires.
- Believed there was a prescribed way of living and acting, without examining the source.

**The Importance of Personal Will:**
- The will is the intensity of desire raised to action.
- It's crucial to recognize and foster our personal will for authentic growth.
- Questioning "What would I do if there was nothing I was supposed to do?" can lead to self-discovery.

**Childhood Conditioning:**
- As children, we are rewarded for obeying societal expectations and punished for disobedience.
- Our will becomes structured by external influences, neglecting our inner needs and direction.
- Obedience is a form of disembodied will that can make us susceptible to manipulation.

**Consequences of Suppressed Will:**
- We become passive-aggressive or reactive in our actions instead of taking strategic steps.
- We may lose touch with our emotions and become apathetic, unable to enter the heart chakra's love.

**The Power of Intention:**
- The will is rooted in desire (wish) and consciousness.
- Our longing fuels the will, which brings future goals into reality.

**Physical Manifestation of Will:**
- The third chakra, located in the solar plexus, represents personal power and self-esteem.
- A strong will keeps our body upright and our chakras aligned, providing vitality and grounding.

**Exercises for Developing Will:**
- Doing exercises like sit-ups can strengthen stomach muscles and support the vulnerable solar plexus area.
- Practicing self-care and setting personal goals can help foster a strong will.

### SELF-ESTEEM

**Self-Esteem**
- Low self-esteem can lead to avoidance of choices and decisions, stifling personal development (Whitmont)
- Energetic vitality requires a healthy sense of self (Whitmont)
- Making mistakes is necessary for growth and developing a sense of power (Whitmont)

**Self-Worth and Shame**
- **Self-worth**: essential for taking care of oneself and feeling confident (Bradshaw)
- High self-worth leads to self-care and personal power (Bradshaw)
- **Shame**: demon of the third chakra, blocks personal power and effective action (Bradshaw)
- Shame transforms into a toxic identity when it takes over one's whole being (Bradshaw)
- Shame-bound personalities feel stuck and engage in compulsive repetition and addiction (Bradshaw)

**Proactivity**
- Being proactive is an alternative to being reactive or inactive (Covey)
- Proactive people choose their actions, take responsibility for shaping their future, and are a causative influence on their environment (Covey)

**Power**
- Power as the ability to make change and transform (Starhawk)
- Power is not a thing but a process of becoming real (Starhawk)
- Power comes from authenticity, taking risks, making mistakes, and being responsible for them (Starhawk)

### TRAUMAS AND ABUSES

**Traumas and Abuses: The Story of Carl**

* Claude Steiner's story about an ordinary man named Carl
* Carl enjoyed sitting in the park basking in the sun
* One day, a large uniformed man blocked the sun from Carl
* Carl tried to move but the man followed, blocking the sun again
* Carl asked the man to move but he refused
* Carl became angry and tried to push him away
* The man responded by stepping on Carl's foot with his boot
* Carl screamed for help but no one came
* He looked around and saw everyone in the park was being treated similarly
* Most people were passive, some reading, others staring disapprovingly at Carl

**The Loss of Personal Power**

* People are held in places within a culture where personal power is epidemically lost
* People are ostracized for acts of individuality or feared
* To keep power over others, people often give up their freedom and authenticity
* Examples: straight men offended by flamboyantly dressed gay men, obedient wives offended by militant feminism, war veterans offended by peace marchers
* This loss results in a civilization obsessed with creating the shadow of power through warfare and technology
* Numb to our pain, we deplete ourselves, our resources, and our planet
* Cultural myth tells us that power lies outside of ourselves

**The Taking Away of Power**

* It is natural for us to use our life energy to move forward
* Instinctual to protect ourselves
* Authority relieves us of the responsibility of independent action
* We are depleted, numb, and emptied inside
* Our cultural myth perpetuates this powerlessness by telling us that power lies outside of ourselves in approval, gadgets, or a distant god.

**Possible Outcomes for Carl**

* Continued to yell and scream but was chained to his bench
* Gave up rebellion and conformed to expectations
* Rallied support and created an uprising in the park
* Transformed his jailer
* What would you have done?

**Poisonous Pedagogy and Authority:**

* Previous generations believed in the ultimate authority of God, man over woman, parent over child.
* Children were expected to be obedient and quiet, and punishment was believed to be for their own good.
* Measures used to accomplish this ranged from rejection to physical beatings.
* Children may be made an accomplice in their own punishment.
* People spend years in therapy to recover from self-negating beliefs instilled during childhood.
* These beliefs are passed down from generation to generation, denying basic instincts and causing division among individuals.

**Developing Inner Authority:**

* Children contend with various models of authority (parents, caretakers, teachers).
* Inner authority is essential for organizing personal energy into an effective will.
* To command our lives, we need inner authority to make decisions and resist or yield appropriately.
* The absence or presence of inner authority shapes our concept of power and relationships with others.

**Impact of Authority on Inner Authority:**

* Our inner authority is formed by those who held authority over us as children.
* If our parent was authoritarian, our inner authority may be tyrannical or a wimp.
* The gender of the authority figure also influences how we carry and project power.
* Examine the influence of authority in your own life:
  + Central authority figure during childhood?
  + How did they establish their authority?
  + Feelings towards this person and their authority?
  + Obeyed out of respect or fear?
  + Reactions to this authority (rebel, obey, or vary)?
  + Current form and alignment with your life?

**Inner Authority and Inner King:**

* The inner King represents the vital and vigorous inner authority in childhood.
* The inner King may be killed if not protected by inner warriors.
* The absence of inner authority as a child results in its being formed by those who held authority over us.
* Bringing inner authority into better alignment with your life involves recognizing its strengths, aligning it with your values, and making conscious decisions to cooperate willfully or resist with intention.

**Understanding Authority and Punishment**
- Respect for authority resonates with inner truth, invites participation, and increases power and skill (Starhawk)
- Fear-based authority and punishment regress behavior to survival level (Starhawk)

**Effects of Punishment**
- Instills fear, controls behavior, robs free will, conditions automatic reactions (Starhawk)
- Must take away something greater than what might be gained, can be physical or emotional, literal or symbolic

**Impact of Physical and Emotional Abuse**
- Forces acceptance of dictated actions, undermines self-definition and power
- Creates a sense of smallness and vulnerability in the face of power (John Bradshaw)

**Responses to Punishment**
- Comply, rebel, withdraw, manipulate (Starhawk)
- Can make third chakra dysfunctional if they characterize a pattern

**Effects of Denying Authenticity**
- Building power on compliance and living up to expectations instead of authenticity (Starhawk)
- Developing sense of self based on external sources, leading to feelings of inadequacy and weakness if dominance is imposed

**Starhawk's Ways of Responding to Punishment**
1. Comply: being deficient in third chakra function
2. Rebel: being excessive in third chakra function
3. Withdraw: creating stumbling blocks to true effectiveness and responsibility
4. Manipulate: initial rebellion followed by manipulation through withdrawal

**Impact of Childhood Punishment**
- Can lead to passive-aggressive behavior, feeling small, and seeing others as bigger or stronger

**The Parentified Child:**
- It is better for individuals to fulfill their own duties than take on those of others, even if successful.
- Situations within families may require children to assume adult responsibilities prematurely.
- Reasons for this include parental substance abuse, poverty, illness, death, or divorce.
- Children in these situations often feel inadequate and powerless due to unrealistic expectations.
- Recognizing the inappropriateness of these roles and working through feelings is essential for overcoming a sense of inadequacy.

**Effects of Parental Responsibilities on Children:**
- **Janet's Story:** Oldest child of an alcoholic mother and traveling father, took on role of substitute parent at a young age due to mother's substance abuse.
  * Felt powerless and inadequate due to siblings' resentment and household chaos.
  * Struggled academically and did not attend college as a result.
- **Jack's Story:** Son of a prominent surgeon, excelled academically but experienced severe nervous breakdown upon entering college due to feeling inadequate.
  * Constantly pushed beyond age-appropriate level, felt shyness and inferiority around peers.

**Impact on Third Chakra:**
- The third chakra handles raw energy throughout the system.
- **Overstimulation:** Children's sensory systems are overwhelmed when exposed to adult intensity and may react with hypersensitivity or hyperactivity.
- **Understimulation:** Lack of proper stimulation in early childhood can result in feelings of emptiness, fatigue, and fear of sexual inadequacy.

**Effects on Child Development:**
- **Janet and Jack's Stories:** Both children experienced a sense of inadequacy due to premature responsibilities, affecting their self-esteem and academic performance.
- **Randy's Story:** Lack of stimulation during infancy led to feelings of emptiness, fear of sexual inadequacy, and fatigue.
- Both overstimulation and understimulation can have damaging effects on a child's emotional, physical, and intellectual development.

**Shame** and its Impact:
- Intensifies control and release dynamics
- Results from various forms of childhood abuse or excessive criticism
- Creates a consciousness that scrutinizes and controls behavior
- Collapses the third chakra, affecting breathing, alignment, and perception
- Experienced as an inward spiral in the belly
- Creates a block between mind and body, fuses sense of shame and self

**Origins of Shame:**
- Childhood abuse: physical, emotional, sexual, neglect, abandonment, excessive criticism
- Parental statements like "You ought to be ashamed of yourself!"
- Failure to praise accomplishments or teach self-care
- Unacknowledged parental shame passed down to children

**Effects of Shame:**
- Divides ego from instinctual core
- Reduces the size of the chest cavity and affects breathing
- Displaces chakras six and seven (perception and understanding) from central column
- Affects thoughts and perceptions, causing them to be out of kilter with reality
- Creates a belief of being fatally flawed
- Leads to self-fulfilling prophecy of inferiority

**Shame and Chakras:**
- Shame collapses the third chakra, affecting whole torso and alignment
- Mind tries to run body beyond capabilities, ignoring messages for rest or food
- Denies emotional needs and keeps system run-down.

**Will and Child Raising:**
- Willful children are more challenging to raise due to their energy and desire to make decisions.
- Parents may find it difficult to tolerate this challenge due to being overworked, disengaged, or shame-bound.
- The will is disabled when emotions get bound by shame, freezing the interaction of the mind and will.

**Parental Guidance:**
- Parents should provide guiding principles and final authority for the child's safety and well-being.
- Struggling with a child's natural rhythms can lead parents to break their will, establishing complete authority.
- A separate identity and individuation cannot take place without allowing the child to make decisions and express feelings.

**Impact of Breaking the Will:**
- Breaking the will of a child creates people who lack feeling, enthusiasm, and a healthy sense of power.
- Such individuals are easily manipulated, controlled, and may resort to passive-aggressive behavior or violence.
- Without a strong will, individuals struggle with self-control and personal freedom.

**Rules of Poisonous Pedagogy:**
- **Adults are the masters:** Parents hold all the power and determine what is right and wrong.
- **Child is held responsible for parents' anger:** The child is blamed for adult emotions.
- **Parents must be shielded:** Children should not express feelings that may upset their parents.
- **Child's life-affirming feelings are a threat:** Parents suppress the child's positive emotions.

### CHARACTER STRUCTURE THE ENDURER

**Character Structure:** The Endurer (or Masochist)

**Description:** Sam was described as a dense, muscular, and heavy character with a sad and plaintive expression. His voice did not match his powerful 
body and seemed to come out in a modified whine. He began expressing feelings of fatigue, depression, and feeling stuck in his job.

**Subversion of Muscular System:** In the development of this character structure, the muscular system of the growing child is subverted from its 
natural function of movement to the neurotic function of holding.

**Alexander Lowen's Analysis:** According to Alexander Lowen, Sam was an example of the Endurer character structure.

**Endurer Dilemma:** The Endurer is locked in a holding pattern that binds the energy of the will, restrains autonomy, and compresses spontaneity, joy, 
and optimism. They are caught in a vicious cycle where activity that cannot move forward is turned against the self.

**Block in Energy:** A block in the energy is a place in the psychic and somatic realm where two or more opposing forces meet. The Endurer experiences 
this as feeling stuck between needs that seem mutually exclusive.

**Development of Endurer Structure:** The Endurer structure develops when the parent is overly controlling, squashing the child's emerging autonomy. The
child submits to authority but resists on the inside, leading to passive-aggressive behavior and a tendency to sabotage.

**Characteristics of Endurers:** Endurers are reliable, steady, hardworking, anxious to please, and able to endure. They can stick to business and 
accomplish difficult or unpleasant tasks, but they also have a tendency to sabotage themselves. The ambivalence is between aggression and tender 
feelings.

**History of Sam:** Sam's mother was smothering, his father distant and passive, and his older brother picked on him. When he was just over two years 
old, his sister was born, and his mother forced him into early toilet training to avoid having two children in diapers. He was punished for defending 
himself so that he would not become like his brother. His mother doted on him but controlled him, usurping his autonomy. When he later dropped out of 
college because of poor grades, she refused to speak to him for a number of years.

**Effects of Endurer Structure:** The Endurer's life becomes grim, their energy bound, and their sexuality lukewarm. They feel stuck and have a reduced 
energy level. This results in a deficient third chakra.

**The Endurer Character:**
* Desires approval and affection, leading to conflict between need for love and autonomy
* Feels both manipulated and angry towards the source of affection
* Accepts reality while fighting its demands, resulting in terrible inner conflict (Lowen)
* Conditioned by conditional love as reward or punishment for behavior
* Third and fourth chakras are at odds: love or autonomy but not both
* Root cause is fear of shame and humiliation

**Characteristics of Endurer:**

* Experiences shame attacks when punished or criticized
* Collapses third chakra, making it difficult to protect oneself
* Fears exposure and humiliation, leading to holding in feelings, thoughts, needs, and self
* Primary pattern is holding in, creating blocks in the chakra system (legs, hands, throat, genitals)
* Body becomes dense and large with thick padding between thighs and chest
* Posture reflects shame: tail tucked in, head lowered, third chakra collapsed
* First and fifth chakras are blocked, leading to masochism
* Anger arises but turns inward as energy builds up and is punished internally
* Feelings of hopelessness and despair result from internal conflict between superego and id

**Endurer's Experience:**

* Experiences life as a series of "have-to's"
* Unable to see proactive paths for change
* Believes situations must be tolerated rather than altered
* Liberating current cannot enter upper chakras due to will's submission and resistance
* Inner critic dominates, fueled by shame and fear of exposure

**Healing the Endurer:**

* Expressing both angry and tender feelings
* Releasing anger from self-criticism through externalization
* Acknowledging needs and releasing them from shame
* Movement breaks holding patterns and allows for nurturance
* Building self-esteem to stand up to inner critic and reclaim autonomy

**Grief:** the experience of loss and sorrow that sits on the heart chakra when Thanatos strikes. It makes the heart heavy and hard to open, leading to numbness, rigidity, and a sense of being dead inside if denied.

### LOVE OPENS WITH FEELING
- Feelings are the antennae of the soul, acting as sensory organs for emotional experiences.
- Hurt feelings lead to protective reactions and closing off emotions.
- The realm of feelings is located in the second chakra and accessed through breath in the heart chakra.

**Breath and Feelings:**
- Holding back feelings results in holding the breath, restricting air flow, and deadening oneself.
- Deepening the breath allows repressed feelings to surface and restore natural balance.
- Practicing breath work with a trusted friend or therapist is beneficial.
- Yoga breathing exercises (pranayama) can also be used to open the chest and charge the body with prana, the vital energy of air.

**Observing the Breath:**
- Most people do not pay attention to their breathing patterns.
- The first step in breath work is observing your own breathing and allowing someone else to observe you breathe.
- Feedback from an observer can help identify when and how you hold the breath during the cycle.
- Smooth and balanced breathing is the goal, with an emphasis on belly or chest breathing.
- Consciously expanding restricted areas can bring forth feelings, impulses, and desires.
- Try not to block these emotions during the practice.

### REACHING OUT AND TAKING IN WITH THE BREATH

**Exercise for Opening the Heart:** A simple practice that coordinates arm movements with breath for facilitators.

**Step One:**
- Have partner lay down with knees bent, feet in contact with ground
- Observe their breathing patterns and aware of held areas
- Encourage relaxation by gently touching constricted areas and massaging shoulders, pectoral muscles, and heart chakra area
- Use props like a pillow to help open the heart area if needed

**Step Two:**
- Encourage partner to reach arms forward on exhale and pull in toward heart on inhale
- Suggest focusing on love during inhale and letting go or offering during exhale
- Observe which direction (reaching or pulling) is more challenging for the partner

**Step Three:**
- Stand behind partner and grab hands
- Offer resistance during inhale when partner pulls arms in and during exhale when they push away
- Increases energy flow and helps release blocked feelings.

### GRIEF WORK 

* Unshed grief restricts breath; deep breathing releases grief
* Grief based on loss, especially of loved ones
* Loss may lead to loss of parts of self (inner child, tender self, etc.)
* Important to regain connection with self rather than increasing attachment to what was lost
* Asking questions: Why was this person special? What did they bring to us? What part of self was bonded?
* Grieving reclaims sacred essence within ourselves
* Triggers previous unhealed wounds
* Cleaning wounds leads to wholeness
* Remembering hope and looking for "pony" in manure (meaning finding positivity amidst pain)

**Forgiveness:**

* Protecting heart from harm may barricade it against receiving and healing
* Blame acts as a barrier to forgiveness
* Forgiveness allows heart to lighten and move on
* Importance of self-forgiveness: understanding our actions, separating mistake from essence, making amends if necessary
* Treating activated part of self with compassion
* Difficulty in forgiving others: working through feelings before forgiveness
* Forgiveness an organic process, renews openness and awareness, frees up energy for positive future.

### LOVE MUST BE WILLED AND CREATED, AS WELL AS FELT

**Love as a Verb:**
- Love is not just a feeling, but an action that requires commitment
- Covey advised a man to "love her" even when feelings were not present
- Love is created through serving, sacrificing, listening, empathizing, appreciating, and affirming others
- Love is a daily commitment that requires effort and attention

**Fantasizing About Love:**
- Imagining ideal relationships can help reprogram the heart chakra
- Allowing feelings to fully permeate the body during fantasy helps nourish and heal
- Visualizing supportive and loving relationships at various stages of life can help us grow and develop

**Expanding Beyond the Self:**
- The fourth chakra encourages connection with all life beyond our own ego
- Acts of selfless service and altruism can uplift both giver and receiver
- Giving unexpected favors to others or even to ourselves can help us expand our sense of love

**Maintaining a Balance of Energies:**
- The heart chakra requires balance between intimacy and autonomy
- Neglecting boundaries can lead to unconscious shutting down and withdrawal
- Engaging in active acts of love, such as reaching out and taking action, can help maintain a healthy balance of energies.

### COME CLOSER, GO AWAY

**Exercise: "Come Closer, Go Away"**

* Sit in front of partner with hands meeting at heart level
* Partner pulls hands towards his heart saying "Come closer"
* Offer resistance but allow movement
* Partner pushes hands back saying "Go away"
* Offer resistance but allow movement
* Repeat process, switching roles
* Discuss how it mirrors relationship dynamics
* Who initiates pulling/pushing/resisting?
* What effect does it have?
* Is it balanced?

**Healing the Heart Chakra**

* Brings acceptance and openness for spirit to find peace
* Fourth chakra allows letting go after third chakra's work
* Being as opposed to doing is qualitative difference between fourth and third chakras
* Healing heart involves attending to vulnerable aspects within
* Cannot be forced with manipulation, derision, or command
* Love exposes instinctual core and enables evolution
* Embraces and heals larger world around us
* Relationships further individual and collective soul evolution

**Resonance and Vibration:**
- All life is rhythmic and resonating system
- Each waveform has a frequency that describes how frequently waves rise and fall
- Resonance is a state of synchronization among vibrational patterns
- When two or more sounds from different sources vibrate at the same frequency, they resonate together
- Rhythmic entrainment of various frequencies forms a coherent central vibration

**Principles of Vibration and Resonance:**
- Waves oscillate back and forth at the same rhythm when in resonance
- Waves add height and lock into phase with each other
- Oscillating waveforms tend to stabilize when they enter into resonance
- Resonant frequencies bond together (rhythm entrainment or sympathetic vibration)

### TRAUMAS AND ABUSES
- Traumas do not make us emotionally ill, but the inability to express them does. (Alice Miller)
- Trauma impacts us with a vibration that we are meant to express.
- Restricting expression results in loss of resonance and disconnection from life.
- Unexpressed trauma is stored in the body as stress.
- Blockage in the throat chakra impedes energy flow and expression.

**Impact of Trauma:**
- Unacknowledged vibrations from external sources can cause stress.
- Strong negative impacts or intolerable situations that cannot be expressed lead to frozen trauma at the core.
- Hiding and blocking emotions is a form of protection against exposure, harm, or ridicule.

**Reasons for Blocking Expression:**
- Shame, fear for safety, or disconnection from the core self can prevent expression.
- Physical signs of hiding include tightened neck and shoulders, misaligned head, talking about anything except the real issue, stuffing food, and 
inertia.

**Consequences of Blocked Expression:**
- Hiding keeps us in isolation and prevents intimacy and evolution.
- Long-term blockages make it harder to open up and express ourselves.
- Breaking silence requires overcoming habits and demons from the lower chakras.

**Secrets:**

* All action is communication, keeping secrets requires constant vigilance over what we say and express non-verbally
* Children who are forced to keep secrets may experience:
  + Sexual abuse survivors: fear, terror, suicide, internalized silence
  + Children with family secrets: guarded expression, difficulty in intimate relationships
* Secrets kept from children can impede problem-solving skills and emotional exploration
* Sexuality is another common forbidden subject, leading to shame and guilt
* Secrets block the flow of energy through the fifth chakra, perpetuating negative patterns

**Effects of Secrets:**

* Ignorance: secrets prevent new information from being gained
* Emotional suppression: unable to express or acknowledge true feelings
* Physical symptoms: terror, shame, guilt, addiction, compulsive behavior
* Difficulties in relationships: intimacy, trust, communication

**Lies and Mixed Messages:**

* Lies create dissonance within the self

* Inner critic guards fifth chakra, regulates speech
* Resulting in vicious self-criticism and difficulty expressing emotions.

**YELLING AND SCREAMING**

* Children learn by imitation, including language use and communication skills
* Hostile home atmosphere (yelling, screaming, arguing) can negatively impact communication development
* Unpleasant environment may lead to shutting down aural functions and inner counter-dialogue
* Later in life, difficulty listening to others, entertaining new ideas, and being open to hearing truth

**Authoritarianism:**

* Rigid rules without room for discussion limit child's ability to learn communication skills
* Lack of a safe space for children to express their truth may lead to feelings of devaluation
* Inability to listen impairs clear communication

**Neglect:**

### RESTORING THE LOTUS HEALING THE FIFTH CHAKRA
- A friend offered voice lessons in exchange for bodywork, but discovered she couldn't project her voice fully without crying (Emotional Connection to Voice)
- The human body is a living resonator of sound, and releasing bodily tensions essential for freeing the throat chakra
- Process of getting in touch with basic pulsating vibration: holding breath, feeling contraction and release, experiencing streaming (Reclamation of Body)
- Containing strong urges to move forward can result in poor timing and lack of energy (Proper Timing)

**Emotional Connection to Voice:**
- Emotions are connected to the voice and cannot be hidden while singing or projecting voice
- Healing involves letting out sound of grief and anger, as well as talking about feelings and putting them into intellectual context

**The Vibrating Body:**
- Human body is a living resonator of sound, affecting each atom and resonating with sounds we make
- Release of bodily tensions necessary to restore natural reflexive and vibratory nature of the body
- Process of getting in touch with basic pulsating vibration: holding breath, feeling contraction and release, experiencing streaming

**Proper Timing:**
- Containing energy and expressing ourselves before our truth is fully ripened can result in poor timing and lack of energy
- Financial pressure, emotional insecurity, fear, hunger for power, and excessive rule of the mind can push us out of sync with our natural rhythm
- Lower chakras becoming strong allows proper timing to occur and dancing to the rhythm of our own personal vibration.

### EXERCISE
- Move freely around the room with eyes closed
- Let movements be instinctual rather than deliberate
- Make abstract sounds as you move
- Coordinate movement and sound for a vibrational experience

**Cleaning Out The Field:**
- Pay attention to outer vibrations (sound pollution, media, rhythms of daily life)
- Identify sources of toxic noise and people
- Eliminate or reduce exposure to toxic noise (soundproofing, earplugs, etc.)
- Take regular periods of quiet time for self-reflection and consciousness expansion

**Importance of Sound Awareness:**
- Ears remain open constantly
- Important to pay attention to outer vibrations and their impact on our consciousness
- Eliminating distracting patterns helps deepen communication with ourselves and others

**Deep Listening:**
- Inner listening connects heart and mind
- Silence is essential for true communication and self-reflection
- Practicing inner listening allows upper and lower chakras to resonate, connecting mind and body

**Exercise:**
- Sit in a quiet place and listen to various sounds around you
- Blend all sounds into one general sound
- Allow your body to subtly move with the rhythm of the combined sound
- Follow where the movement takes you while staying with the overall sound.

### TONING

**Toning** encourages natural expression of sound from the throat, unencumbered by intellectual meaning or aesthetic appeal. It is a spontaneous response to physical or emotional stimuli.

* Toning is not forced into specific words, melodies, or sounds
* Natural sounds emerge when we are moved physically or emotionally
* Embarrassment often leads to stifling these sounds, closing down the throat chakra

**Benefits of Toning:**

* Relieves pain by releasing tension through groans and other sounds
* Best done after warming up the body

**Warm-up Exercise:**

1. Stand erect and stretch body in all directions
2. Shake out legs and swing arms to loosen up
3. Close eyes, take deep breath, and let sound emerge
4. Find a sustainable note that resonates with you
5. Sing the note fully, feeling where it originates in your body
6. Let go of the tone naturally and notice how you feel

**Preparation for Toning:**

* Stand with feet planted firmly on the ground
* Close eyes and take deep breath
* Open mouth and let sound emerge spontaneously

**Toning Technique:**

1. Find a sustainable note that resonates with you
2. Sing this note fully, reaching for resonance and relaxation
3. Feel where the sound originates in your body (throat, chest, belly, or head)
4. Let it come from your whole body at once, integrating disconnected parts
5. Release the tone naturally and notice how you feel

**Post-Toning:**

* Write or draw in a journal to release creativity
* Notice feelings of presence and relaxation.

### CHANTING AND USING MANTRAS 

* Mantra: a state indicative of the presence of divinity, a more sophisticated form of toning
* Chanting: rhythmic repetition of a simple phrase or sound lulls consciousness into resonance, bypasses conscious mind, allows for deeper resonance or trance state
* Mantras are chants uttered silently in the mind, cleanses and orders the mind, expands individuated consciousness to merge with greater consciousness
* Transcendental Meditation (TM): a meditation technique where one mentally repeats a given mantra to create meditative state and synchronize brain waves

**Benefits of Chanting Mantras:**

* Synchronizes brain waves between various lobes of the brain
* Recalibrates basic vibrational essence
* Enter quiet and rhythmic state, free from mental garbage
* Releases "liquid nectar" in the pineal gland, contributing to altered consciousness
* Resonates with specific chakras (seed sounds and vowel sounds listed)

**Chanting Techniques:**

* Silently chant mantra given by teacher or create own mantra
* Each chakra has a specific mantra sound (seed sound and vowel sound listed)
* Experiment with both seed sounds and vowel sounds to find what works best
* Sit or stand comfortably, deep breaths, let sound resonate fully in body for at least 1 minute when alone, longer with a group

**Creating Your Own Mantra:**

* Pick sounds that resonate with one, two, or three chakras needing attention
* Put sounds together in a pleasing way
* Sit in silent meditation and mentally intone the created sound
* Imagine expanding or clearing the chosen chakras (best results with consistent use over time)

### COMMUNICATION

**Throat Chakra and Communication:**
- Techniques for toning the chakra help sounds resonate easily through the body
- Focus on effective communication with others, which includes understanding their perspective

**The Need to be Heard:**
- Quote from Steven R. Covey: "If you wish to be understood, seek first to understand"
- Human need to be heard is profound and validates our truth, individuality, and existence
- Inability to be heard can lead to feelings of insanity, doubt, and disconnection from reality
- Sometimes more important than finding solutions is acknowledging the other person's feelings

**Communication Dynamics:**
- Example of couples not being able to effectively communicate due to unmet need to be heard
- Karen needed George to acknowledge her struggles, even if he couldn't change them
- George wanted Karen to understand his own difficulties with his job and absence from home
- Neither was able to express or feel heard, leading to a strained connection

**Importance of Listening:**
- Deep listening can lead to healing and improved communication
- Simple practice of acknowledging someone's feelings can go a long way toward resolving issues
- Understanding the other person's perspective is crucial for effective communication.

### ACTIVE LISTENING

**Active Listening:**
- Enables another person to feel heard
- Quiet self and focus entire energy on speaker
- Nod or say "mmhm" for acknowledgement, no interruptions or comments
- Ask if speaker is complete before responding
- Repeat what was heard in own words without parroting exact phrases
- Co-communicator corrects misunderstandings, clarifying their perspective
- Both parties must be satisfied that they have been truly heard before sharing own truth

**Communication:**
- Difficulties can be addressed by recording conversations or writing out feelings
- Writing allows for finding one's voice and clarity in communication
- Practice active listening during written communication to deepen understanding

**David's Experience:**
- Struggled to communicate effectively with wife due to personality differences
- Encouraged to write down unexpressed feelings without censoring them
- Read writing aloud for active listening and building trust in own voice
- Practice sticking to truth in face of opposition through role-playing

**Writing:**
- A form of communication that transcends time
- Allows for finding voice, clarity, and completion
- Can be used for unresolved situations with unreachable or unresponsive people

**Music:**
- A cry of the soul and revelation of human emotion
- Performances can serve as initiation into the mysteries of the human soul.

**Shamanic Use of Music and Drumming**

* Works on principle of resonance for healing
* Transcends ego and enters broader spiritual state

**Science of Music's Impact on the Brain**

* Surrounded by limbic system, which affects emotions and endocrine system

**Indian Philosophies on Sound and Music**

* Sound is primordial ingredient of creation
* Given to Brahma and Saraswati for creation and beginnings
* Creator of consciousness that maintains the web of life
* Fifth chakra facilitates passage between abstract information and manifested realm
* Sound brings us into resonance and harmony on spiritual plane

- Psychic development requires both intention and attraction of symbol (Jung)
- Entering brow chakra, looking back with new vision and seeing pattern
  - Building a rainbow bridge with colors of chakras
  - Intuiting necessary steps to complete the pattern
  - Guidance from sight for actions in transformation
- Third eye: inner perception, organ of consciousness and creativity
- Function: seeing the way, bringing light of consciousness to all

**Pattern Recognition**

- "Eyes are gateways to the soul" (Shakespeare)
- Seeing patterns reveals identity and meaning
  - Continue looking beyond initial recognition
- Game of connect the dots analogy
  - Forming incomplete pattern to see whole image
- Chakra six's role: assembling information into meaningful patterns
- Simultaneously seeing past, present, and future
- Recognition can limit or expand possibilities based on interpretation
- Finding insight through recognizing patterns within self
  - Towards wholeness, clarity, extended consciousness.

**Third Eye (Sixth Chakra) Specifics**

- Gateway to soul
- Higher vibration: light
- Basic function: seeing and perceiving beyond physical sight
- Organ of inner perception: third eye
- Witnesses internal screen: memory, fantasy, images, archetypes, intuition, imagination.

### ILLUSION
**Illusion and Perception**
- Illusion is a frozen image that disrupts open-minded perception
- We see things based on our own perspective rather than reality (Anais Nin: "We don't see things as they are. We see things as we are")

**Causes of Illusion**
- Fixation on an image pulls us out of present time and authentic living
- Investment of psychic energy keeps illusion in place
- Obsession results from the more energy invested, the more deeply attached

**Examples of Illusion**
- **Anya**: Adopted illusion of "happily ever after" marriage model, investing all energy into husband and family, denying her own needs and hiding husband's abuse
- **Maria**: Obsessed with fear of abandonment, interpreting present situations based on past experiences (father leaving)

**Effects of Illusion**
- Seals energy into illusion, making it difficult to let go
- Repetitive cycles prevent true understanding
- Illusions can become obsessions or delusions when excessively invested in

**Illusion and Chakras**
- Sixth chakra excess leads to obsession or delusion
- Upper chakras spin wildly without grounded connection to first chakra, resulting in no forward movement

### ARCHETYPES
- Bits of information that reveal the identity of the whole
- Images and experiences constellated by a common theme
- Cannot be seen directly, but apparent in events of our lives
- Influence our life from the unconscious
- Can be symbolically represented by archetypal images
- Lie in the unconscious and influence us through projections

**Archetypes as Instinct:**

**Encountering Archetypes:**
- Recognizing archetypal significance of symbols brings us into a larger spiritual framework
- Understanding the pattern and meaning leads to insight and directed action

**Unconscious:**
- Deposit of all human experience, including archetypes
- A living system of reactions and aptitudes that determine individual life in invisible ways
- Archetypes carry numinous energy and meaning.

**Archetypes:** bits of information that reveal the identity of the whole, psychologically representing instinct as a spiritual goal, composites of 
images and experiences with common themes, shaping our understanding like morphogenetic fields, influencing our lives, cannot be seen directly but are 
apparent in events.

* Archetype as a spiritual goal: C.G. Jung's perspective, archetypes are the precipitate of all human experience, lying in the unconscious and 
influencing life, releasing their projections is a duty.
* Archetypal image: symbolic representation of an archetype, not fully integrated into the ego leads to illusion.
* The Hero archetype: quest for extraordinary achievement, William's drive toward success but felt empty and left his soul thirsting for deeper meaning.
* Chakras and archetypes: each chakra can be correlated to an archetype, has the archetypal energy of its associated element.
* Archetypal pattern: totality of the Self as the central archetype of order in the psyche, formative principle of individuation.

**Individuation:** archetypal process, common elements comprise the archetypal pattern, mirrors the unfolding of the chakras, reclaiming the shadow, 
establishing autonomy, integrating anima and animus, expressing individuality, recognizing archetypal influences, integrating all elements into a 
greater wholeness.

* Archetypal identity: gained through recognition of images and symbols in dreams, imagination, art, relationships, or situations.
* Journeying to the Underworld: metaphor for dealing with loss, acceptance as an inward journey with a sacred purpose.

**Unconscious:** deposit of all human experience, living system of reactions and aptitudes that determine life invisibly, archetypes carry psychic 
charge and meaning.

* Archetypes and instincts: forms which the instincts assume, embedded in a larger field, carry numinous energy.

**Image as Symbol:**

* Archetypes are psychic energies that manifest through symbols (Edward Whitmont)
* We encounter symbols of archetypes, not the archetypes themselves
* Language is made up of sound symbols and visual representations
* Symbols are a whole-brain way of communicating about deep archetypal energies
* Archetypes become integrated into consciousness through symbols
* Pattern recognition leads to emergence of symbols
* Archetypes speak to us in an archetypal language through symbols

**Symbols and the Unconscious:**

* Symbols emerge from dreams, fantasies, art, and chance encounters
* Dreams link conscious and unconscious mind
* Dreams present alternatives to ordinary reality
* Dreams unlock the mystery of soul and spirit connection
* Dreams reveal hidden feelings and understandings
* Dreams bring answers to problems and are spiritual teachers
* Scientific discoveries have been made through dreams

**Symbols and Archetypes:**

### GROWING THE LOTUS DEVELOPMENTAL FORMATION OF THE SIXTH CHAKRA AT A GLANCE

**Sixth Chakra Development:** The ability to think symbolically and abstractly marks the specific development of the sixth chakra. This period is known as formal operations, which begins around age twelve. At this stage, a child can reason about things they have not experienced and live in the symbolic realm.

**Adolescence:**

**Sixth Chakra Development (continued):**
- **Archetypal Hero Worship:** Adolescents search for a meaningful personal identity by engaging in hero worship and experimenting with new identities.
- **Imagination:** The adolescent's imagination often clashes with the older generation's lack of imagination.
- **Persona vs. Identity:** While a social persona is formed relatively unconsciously at the fourth chakra stage, personal identity becomes consciously sought during adolescence as part of the search for meaning in life.

**Impact on Adolescent Development:**
- **Archetypal Dramas:** Archetypal dramas have a significant impact on the creation of identity in adolescents, even if their symbolism is not consciously understood.
- **Personal Identity:** The search for personal meaning and identity during adolescence can lead to experimentation with new roles, ideologies, and cultural icons.
- **Identity vs. Role Confusion:** The dominant concern during adolescence is the search for a meaningful personal identity that resonates with the Self and provides direction for the powerful surge of energy that occurs as physical growth tapers off and sexual energy ripens.

### ADULT DEVELOPMENT

**Adult Development:**
- Awakening of symbolic communication and archetypal identity usually occurs after a midlife crisis or in adolescence.
- Previously adopted roles no longer satisfy, leading to exploration of new possibilities (Sixth chakra development).
- Spiritual awakening brings clarity, insight, and perspective change.
- Can occur at any time in life, often preceded by darkness and personal struggles.

**Traumas and Abuses:**
- Visual memory directly linked with somatic experience.
- Abuses to any chakra can affect the opening of the sixth chakra.
- Repression or dissociation are ways to avoid unpleasant feelings associated with memories.

**Case Study: Sandra**
- Witnessed father's violence towards her mother and repressed the memory, maintaining a false illusion of her father as loving and kind.
- Failed to take action when husband became violent, unable to separate love from abuse.
- Repressed memory affected her psychically, leading to body sensations, dreams, and visual symptoms (glasses).

**Case Study: Tom**
- Dissociated from childhood memories, unable to understand impact of words and actions on others.
- Unacknowledged patterns in relationships led to excessive activation of the sixth chakra, cluttered psyche.

**Impact of Environment:**
- Daily scenes of suffering can close down the sixth chakra and impair physical sight.
- Exploring family dynamics around vision problems can reveal underlying illusions.

**Illusions in Recovery:**
- Falsely remembering past as safe and secure might be an illusion of certainty.
- Children's intuition can be hindered by denial of family secrets or contradictions.

**Shame:**
- Intense self-scrutiny can paralyze the sixth chakra, making it less available for outward vision.

### VISION QUEST 

A spiritual practice involving a solo rite of purification and seeking guidance from the natural world. It is a deep embracing of Self, typically including three phases: separation, quest, and return.

* **Separation:** Leaving the known world behind to psychologically sever oneself from mundane concerns. This usually involves traveling to a wilderness area with minimal equipment and abstaining from food during the heart of the quest.
* **Quest:** Entering a sacred dimension outside time and space, opening fully to spirit. During this phase, one may encounter psychological demons, animal spirits, or have powerful dreams, and there may be an experience of ego death followed by psychological rebirth.
* **Return:** Sharing the vision and wisdom gained with a group or friend upon returning from the solo time. The group or friend can help facilitate the transition back to civilization.

**Light and Malillumination:**

* Humans need exposure to full-spectrum sunlight for optimal health, but artificial lighting and indoor lifestyles decrease our exposure.
* Jacob Liberman's book "Light: Medicine of the Future" discusses the importance of natural light and the negative effects of malillumination, including depression, fatigue, stress hormones, cholesterol levels, hyperactivity, learning disorders, visual difficulties, nutritional problems, tooth decay, and seasonal affective disorder.
* Light enters the body through the eyes and affects the hypothalamus, pineal gland, and endocrine system, regulating vital functions and coordinating the body with the environment.

**Meditation:** A practice that improves focus and concentration and is an important element in psychic development. It calms the mind, making it easier to open inner sight and perceive patterns beyond ordinary awareness.

* The Self contains our past, present, and future life, and ascending to the sixth chakra opens us to transcendent realms, profound insight, and a larger system of being.
* Chakra six expands consciousness through imagination and creativity, preparing us for the final passage on the Rainbow Bridge and understanding the dance of divinity and consciousness in the next chakra.

**DIVING INTO THE RIVER OF CONSCIOUSNESS**

* Erich Jantsch's three levels of human consciousness: rational, mythical, and evolutionary
* **Rational system**: observing and enacting from the riverbank using scientific methods and empirical means. Essential activities are observation and measurement.
* **Mythical system**: immersing in the river, shifting from observation to experience, identifying with the force of the river and embracing a subject-subject relationship. Archetypal consciousness emerges.
* **Evolutionary system**: merging with the river, transcending the rational system, and entering universal mind. I and thou become we. Realizing that divine consciousness is who the Self really is.

**Three System Levels of Human Consciousness by Erich Jantsch:**

1. **Rational system**:
   * Sitting on the riverbank
   * Knowledge comes through science and logical, empirical means
   * Essential activities: observation and enactment
   * I-it relationship: subject to object
2. **Mythical system**:
   * Immersed in the river
   * Shift from observation to experience
   * Identify with the river as a force greater than ourselves
   * Archetypal consciousness emerges
3. **Evolutionary system**:
   * Merging with the river
   * Transcending the rational system
   * I and thou become we
   * Universal mind, union with the divine
   * Expansion into cosmic consciousness

**The Witness:**

* Consciousness within that silently observes emotions, thoughts, impulses, and attachments
* Above and beyond body and experience but silently observes all events
* Indestructible spark of divinity and eternal guide
* Objective and subjective
* Detaches from suffering and teaches us how to swim in the stream when we're flailing about.

**Exercises for Embracing the Witness:**

1. Meditate on the present moment and observe the witness inside you.
2. Practice detaching from your thoughts and emotions while remaining aware of the witness within.
3. Cultivate self-awareness by observing your own reactions and responses to various situations.
4. Engage in spiritual practices that help deepen your connection to the witness, such as prayer or meditation.

### BELIEF SYSTEMS
- The crown chakra can be seen as the operating system in the human psyche, interpreting instructions and deriving meaning from experiences.
- Meaning gives purpose to life and influences how we interpret and react to events.
- Beliefs are formed based on interpretations of experiences and become the operating system for other chakras.
- Our beliefs shape our reality and are influenced by past experiences.
- Reprogramming work in the crown chakra involves examining and questioning belief systems.

**Formation of Beliefs:**
- Beliefs are made up of interpretations of experiences, forming a continual feedback system.
- Conception is the beginning point of all that we manifest, including our beliefs and concepts.
- DNA in biological conception contains "in-form-ation" that organizes tissue into a particular form.
- Our beliefs act as ordering principles for information and guide behavior.

**Impact of Beliefs on Reality:**
- The nature of our belief system determines our interpretation of events and influences the way we order our lives.
- Different beliefs lead to different interpretations of the same event, which can affect behavior and interactions with others.
- Our beliefs shape our reality and are shaped by it in a continual cycle.

**Examining Belief Systems:**
- The awakened crown chakra questions all belief systems, constantly reprogramming and upgrading the operating system of our lives.
- It is easier to generate shifts in consciousness than applying insights to changing one's life, but outer changes are impossible without inner awakening.
- Reprogramming work in the crown chakra involves examining and challenging limiting beliefs that no longer serve us.

### UNIVERSAL IDENTITY

- Each identity explored in the text represents a metaphoric layer of clothing that unfolds towards unity and recognition of the one. (C.G. Jung)

**First Chakra: Physical Identity**

- Identification with the body and its needs and abilities, self-preservation.

**Second Chakra: Emotional Identity**

- Transforms physical sensations into value-oriented meaning, sparks desire and motivation, self-gratification.

**Third Chakra: Will Identity (Ego Identity)**

- Birth of the executive element of the Self, separate from unconscious drives, primarily concerned with self-definition.

**Fourth Chakra: Social Identity**

- Expands ego identity to include relationships with others, serves toward service to others, self-acceptance essential for acceptance of others.

**Fifth Chakra: Creative Identity**

- Seeks to make a contribution to the world through art and creativity, self-expression.

**Sixth Chakra: Archetypal Identity**

- Identification with transpersonal, mythic forces that guide our world and lives, self-reflection on divine energies.

**Seventh Chakra: Universal Identity**

- Identification with all of creation, understanding of interconnectedness with the entire web of life, requires consciousness expansion.

- Each identity is a belief system and a means of interpretation, influences how we relate to the world and others.
- Realizing universal identity requires a foundation of lower identities in place.

### ATTACHMENT—DEMON OF THE CROWN CHAKRA

**Crown Chakra Demon: Attachment**

* Inhibits expansion and growth in the crown chakra
* Necessary for commitments but denies the fluid state of the universe
* Keeps us anchored, unable to move forward
* Sources of suffering in Eastern religions

**Characteristics of Attachment**

* Slippery demon: necessary but can become a problem
* Renouncing attachment may not be a spiritual act
* Can lead to escapism instead of growth
* About how we direct psychic energy

* One person's avoidance becomes another's attachment
* Both sides need willingness to release or face issues
* Centers involved: third chakra (ego)

**Meditation and Consciousness Expansion**

* Silent mind widens consciousness
* Turns towards any point in the universe for knowledge.

### HIGHER POWER 
**Higher Power and Twelve-Step Movement:**

* Higher power is an essential aspect of the twelve-step movement for addiction and disorder recovery.
* Connecting to a higher power involves surrendering attachments, belief systems, habits, and need for control.
* Early experiences with higher power come from parents and shape our ability to trust and surrender.
* Surrender does not require abandoning lower states but releasing defenses and attachments.

**Transcendence and Immanence:**

* The crown chakra is a gateway to the infinite and to creation.
* Transcendence is the goal of moving up through the chakras, offering liberation.
* Immanence is the path of manifestation, with the divine existing in everything living and nonliving.
* Creation is an expression of the divine that is profound and refined.

**Soul vs. Spirit:**

* The soul gathers spirit, forming an individual's abstract being.
* Spirit seeks transcendence and universality, while the soul focuses on manifestation and embodiment.

**Embracing the Gods:**

* We are all elements of the divine but often forget or contract our divinity.
* Embracing deity within inspires greater consciousness and responsibility.
* Becoming a god/goddess requires commitment to consciousness and attention to every moment.
* Mythology embodies archetypal energies, offering infinite manifestations of the divine.

**Quotes:**
- "We are as Gods and might as well become good at it." - Stewart Brand
- "Whoever worships another divinity than his self, knowing him not, knows not." - Brihadaranyaka Upanishad

### TRAUMAS AND ABUSE

**Traumas and Abuses:**
- Abuses to the crown chakra limit focus and concentration.
- Withholding information can deprive children of proper mental nourishment and shut down their curiosity.

**Withholding Information:**
- Parents may withhold information from children, believing it's for their own good.
- Children are naturally curious and seek knowledge, withholding it can limit their development.
- Poor education can also hinder a child's natural hunger for knowledge.

**Spiritual Abuse:**
- Forcing unrealistic purity or spiritual belief systems on children can close the crown chakra and produce shame and fear.
- Children should be allowed to explore spirituality at their own pace in a loving and respectful environment.
- Exposure to a variety of spiritual options is important for healthy development.

- Can stunt their intellectual growth and limit their understanding of the world.

**Impact of Poor Education:**
- Fails to stimulate and support a child's natural curiosity and hunger for knowledge.
- Makes learning a tedious and boring task instead of a joyous exploration.

**Spiritual Abuse Examples:**
- Forcing children to accompany parents in proselytizing can cause fear, shame, and negative experiences with spirituality.
- Insisting on perfection or teaching that they are full of sin can also close the crown chakra.

**Importance of Validation:**
- Validating a child's questions and curiosity can help them understand the world around them.
- Allows for healthy intellectual growth and an open crown chakra.

Traumas and abuses to the crown chakra, including withholding information or spiritual abuse, can limit focus and concentration or produce shame and fear, making it harder for individuals to open up to their own personally fulfilling spirituality. Children are naturally curious and need proper mental nourishment through access to knowledge, a loving environment, and validation of their questions. Poor education can also hinder intellectual growth and curiosity, while spiritual abuse can cause negative experiences with spirituality and limit options for healthy exploration.

	+ Dhyana (meditation or merging): allowing it to merge with the object
	+ Samadhi (ecstasy): experiencing state of total absorption and no longer a sense of subject and object
* Receptive meditation: opening to flow of thoughts, feelings, or impulses and following wherever it might lead.

### MINDFULNESS

**Mindfulness:** essential key to conscious living; fundamental quality in the crown chakra; enables full experience of present moment; requires examining who we are and questioning our perspective; paying attention to subtle flavors and textures of each moment; brings past and future into present consciousness; underlies concept "Waiting Is"

**Characteristics of Mindfulness:**
- **Paying Attention:** noticing every moment without attachment
- **Present Moment Awareness:** enabling full experience and satisfaction
- **Connection:** being in touch with experiences and emotions
- **Avoiding Defenses:** no dissociation, presumptions, numbness, impatience, fear, or chakra demons

**Benefits of Mindfulness:**
- **Open Attention:** new possibilities and freedom from unconsciousness
- **Rich Information:** full information equals intelligence, avoids suffering
- **State of Observation:** does not judge, value, negate, or applaud; simply witnesses

**Enemies of Mindfulness:**
- **Dissociation:** disconnecting from experience
- **Presumptions:** not allowing present moment to unfold uniquely
- **Numbness:** shutting off valuable information and robbing fullness of experience
- **Impatience:** rushing to the future, not realizing richness of present
- **Fear:** cannot fully engage, contracts attention

**Quotes:**
> Mindfulness means paying attention. It involves noticing the subtle flavors and textures of each moment and appreciating their many interwoven levels of meaning without getting attached to any particular one.
> 
> We keep [the past and future] consciously in sight as ways to enhance the meaning of the present.
> 
> In waiting, we are not putting our attention on the future, but experiencing the perfection of the unfolding present.
> 
> When we commit ourselves to paying attention in an open way, without falling prey to our own likes and dislikes, opinions and prejudices, projections and expectations, new possibilities open up and we have a chance to free ourselves from the straightjacket of unconsciousness.

- Limiting beliefs hinder growth (e.g., "I can't do it," "It's impossible").
- Anything is possible, and belief systems originate from experiences and influences.

**Exploring the Origin of Beliefs:**
- Trace beliefs back to their source by asking: When did I first get this idea? Where did those thoughts come from?
- Identify outer influences (parents, peers, literature, loved ones).
- Reach core experience and ask: Is this a belief I constructed?
- Consider the beliefs that influenced previous experiences.

**The Role of Consciousness and Information:**
- Consciousness brings us information to conduct our lives.
- Each chakra has unique needs for growth (e.g., first chakra needs food and touch).
- The seventh chakra feeds on information.

**Importance of Continuous Learning:**

### RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY

* C.G. Jung's perspective on psychic wholeness: energy withdrawal from external deities to psyche
* Origin of the word religion: reconnecting with spirit, soul, and eternal aspects of life
* Religion as a psychic structure for connecting with the world
* Seven lotus metaphor: religion is one of many petals, impacts crown chakra
* Drives towards religion: security (root chakra), emotional fulfillment (sacral chakra), power, community, creative expression (solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye)
* Spiritual growth vs. religious obstacles: denial of feelings, avoidance, control, righteousness
* Adapting religion as a defense
* Religion's benefits: structure, practice, community, support, grounding practices (meditation, choir, rituals, puja, yoga, service)
* Importance of religion with a practice vs. just ideas and concepts.

## CONCLUSION

- Unfolding petals of chakras, bringing deeper meaning and richer life experiences

**The Journey Continues:**
- Not about reaching a destination but being conscious throughout the journey
- Bring depth and wisdom to every level
- Uncovering obstacles is not the end, it's the beginning of another voyage in consciousness

**The Return Trip:**
- Psychic realization or discovery of the soul is just the start
- Another voyage made in consciousness instead of ignorance
- World still needs wisdom and guidance, even with enlightenment or awakening.

**Sri Aurobindo's Teachings on Chakras: The Descent of Consciousness**

* Journey from top to bottom in consciousness development
* Access to upper chakras is unconscious; we don't live there yet
* As we grow, we encounter energy coming down from the top
* Upper chakra energies filter down, but we don't operate from those levels fully
* In the journey downward:
	+ Instead of basing decisions on feelings, use principles
	+ Devise strategies instead of repeating impulsive patterns
	+ Create who we are instead of discovering who we are
* Energy coming up from the ground is dynamic and expansive
* Energy coming down from the top is systematic and calm
* Chakras once fully realized:
	+ Crown chakra: state of being, consciousness is an experience, not a thing
	+ Illumination brings inspiration to creativity
	+ Understanding necessary for compassion in heart chakra
	+ Power becomes directed transformation with intelligence
* Emotions and sexuality deepen and broaden understanding
* Consciousness makes the body fully alive, and body gives consciousness a place to live

**Ideas on Enlightenment:**

* Enlightenment comes in pieces, it happens a little bit every day
* We gain wisdom from insights, feelings, relationships, successes/failures
* Change ourselves, change the world (we're a complete, indivisible system)

### PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

**Assessing Chakra Balance**

* Divide a piece of paper into four columns: Issues, Strengths, Excess, and Deficiency
* Go through the chakra lists in the book and write down applicable words for each column
* Have a friend assess you and compare results
* Use strengths to address weaker areas
* Consider journaling and healing activities

**Top-Down Approach**

* Use excessive energy to build up deficient energy
* Excess in 6th chakra: visualize a healthy body or better relationship
* Strong communicators: use skills to increase sense of power, improve relationships
* Highly disciplined: use discipline for physical exercises, meditative practices

**Five Basic Character Structures**

* Each person's energy distribution through chakras is unique
* Five basic structures: Overcontroller, Controller, Avoider, Compulsive, and Pleaser

**Four Basic Patterns of Unbalanced Energy Distribution**

* Top-down: excess moves down to deficiency
	+ Excess in higher chakras, deficiency in lower ones
* Bottom-up: deficiency moves up to excess
	+ Deficient in lower chakras, excessive in upper ones
* Inside-out: deficiency moves from core outward
	+ Low self-esteem, poor boundaries, fear of intimacy
* Outside-in: excess moves from external environment inward
	+ Overstimulation, addiction, dependency on others

**General Principles**

* Use assessment to understand energy patterns
* Use strengths to address weaknesses

### TOP-DOWN SYSTEMS

* Characteristics: live primarily in their heads, excessive upper chakras, deficient lower ones, thinking-intuitive types, ponder before acting, often intellectual or analytical jobs

### KUNDALINI AWAKENING As one opens the door with a key, so the yogi should open the gate to liberation with Kundalini. She gives liberation to the yogi 

**Kundalini Awakening**

* A spiritual experience described as the awakening of a dormant energy at the base of the spine in Hindu mythology
* Kundalini is represented as a serpent goddess, Shakti, coiled three and a half times around the first chakra
* Awakening occurs when the Kundalini energy begins to rise through the body, piercing and opening the chakras
* Symptoms may include twitching, intense heat, shaking, emotional instability, hallucinations, and extreme mood swings

**Classical Psychology Perspective**

* Marlena's symptoms could be mistakenly diagnosed as a psychotic break
* However, these symptoms can also indicate Kundalini awakening

**Causes of Kundalini Awakening**

* Extended periods of meditation, yoga, fasting, stress, trauma, psychedelic drugs, or near-death experiences
* Can be triggered by mundane experiences as well

**Experience and Effects**

* Intense energy undulates in the body as it rises through the chakras

7. Practice grounding: Establish a strong foundation for the Kundalini energy through grounding exercises
8. Practice yoga: Strengthen the body, purify subtle channels, and awaken chakras to facilitate a smooth passage of Kundalini energy

- Causes Shiva to move into manifestation as the dance (Shiva Nataraja)
- In union with Shiva: primordial emanations of life

**Cosmic Principles:**
- Male and female, upper and lower, form and chaos, transcendence and immanence

**Invoking Shiva's Energy:**
