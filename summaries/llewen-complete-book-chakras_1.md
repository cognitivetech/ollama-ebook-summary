### WHAT IS A CHAKRA?

**Chakras**

* Energy organs managing physical, psychological, and spiritual energies
* Seven-chakra system, originated from Hinduism
* Locations and conclusions drawn into chakra systems
* Made of energy, have important jobs, work together like cogs in a machine
* Swirling vortexes of light, not physical organs
* Each manages specific area of body, emotions, mental concerns, intuitive gifts, spiritual identity
* Can be pictured as lotus flowers with varying number of petals (vortexes)
* Major chakras have 7 vortexes each, emanating from front and back sides of spine
* Each has a name, bodily location, purpose, color, endocrine gland association, etc.
* Anchored in physical body, perform highly physical functions
* Draw on special energy called kundalini for health and spiritual transformation

### CHAKRA STRUCTURE

- Seven chakras with seven bands of colors and sounds
- Each occupies its own horizontal band of vibrating energy
- Manage whatever comes their way that matches their energy band

**Chakra Substructures**

- Located along the vertical axis of the body
- Extend outward to the front and back
- Have inner and outer wheels
- Lower chakras are more material, higher ones are more spiritual

**Chakras and Brain Hemispheres**

- Left side receives energy and is feminine
- Right side transmits energy and is masculine
- Energy flows into left side, processed in chakras, projected from right side

**Chakra Function**

- Each chakra has a left and right side, yin and yang
- Energy enters through left side, pours out through right in a circular motion
- Number of hubs or petals varies based on energetic frequency

**Chakras and Spine**

- Front and back sides serve different functions
- Back side receives energy, filters depending on soul issues
- Front sides help create reality and share information with the world

**Additional Chakra Aspects**

- May have inner and outer spheres or circles
- Inner wheel programs essential spirit during conception, holds keys to dharma
- Outer wheel programs during conception, assists adaptation to family system and culture, holds self-destructive beliefs.

### WHAT DOES THE SPIN OF A HEALTHY CHAKRA LOOK LIKE?

**Chakra Spin**

- Complex interaction enabling conversion of energy
- **Healthy chakra**: 
  - clockwise when taking in energy
  - counterclockwise when releasing it (not always the case)
- **Disturbed chakra**: 
  - spin disturbed
  - appears weak
  - misshapen or too open
- Clockwise spinning chakra can take in unhealthy energy
- Counterclockwise spin necessary for releasing energy and emotions
- Chakras may shift direction at certain times (e.g., menstruation, grief)
- **Assessing chakra spin**: only outer wheel can be assessed, inner wheel can only be accessed in deep meditation
- Inner wheel flows with higher needs, corrects distorted external wheel spin
- Some individuals have counterclockwise chakras (shamanic and mystical people)
- Understanding energy and chakra interaction essential for comprehending chakras fully.

### THE THREE MAIN FUNCTIONS OF THE CHAKRAS

- **Physical Processing**:
  - Located in the body, managing a certain part and related to physical senses
  - Described by colors and sounds
  - Interact with nerves and endocrine glands

- **Psychological Processing**:
  - Involved in beliefs and feelings
  - Create psychological constructs affecting well-being

- **Spiritual Processing**:
  - Contributes to spiritual development and consciousness
  - Serves as a channel for specific psychic abilities

**Additional Information about Chakras:**

- **Memory Banks**:
  - Record and hold information related to the three roles
  - Remember conclusions drawn and reactions of others
  - Function from conception

- **Energy Transformers**:
  - Exchange and transform subtle and physical energy
  - Hold key to physical and spiritual changes
  - Change subtle energy into physical energy and vice versa

### 1. CHAKRAS PROCESS PHYSICALLY

* Chakras have physical locations inside or atop the body, even though their vibrational frequencies can't be proven with modern technology
* Every chakra functions on a different vibratory plane and interacts with a particular level or layer of the body
* Often described as a rainbow bridge due to their progression through the seven colors of the rainbow
* Each chakra is linked to a major nerve plexus, endocrine gland, and regulates core physical, psychological, and spiritual functions
* Chakras are ultrasensitive and manage physical concerns by monitoring specific body parts, organs, and tissues within their vibratory band
* Each chakra is associated with a primal element and vertebral region or spinal nerve plexus
* Chakras hold memory of past traumas or events that can be triggered to respond in some way.

**First Chakra:**
- Located in the hips, through the coccygeal plexus and adrenal glands
- CEO of hips, coccygeal vertebrae, anus, bladder, rectum, and adjacent body parts
- Regulates safety, security, and physicality
- Ultrasensitivity makes it effective at managing physical concerns related to these areas.

**Example:** A client with unexplained hip pain was unable to recall any injuries or causes. Through chakra healing, the practitioner discovered that the client had been injured as a child but had forgotten the incident. The memory and associated pain were released, resulting in the pain disappearing.

### 2. CHAKRAS PROCESS PSYCHOLOGICALLY

* Chakras manage specific sets of beliefs and related emotions

**First chakra:** deals with safety and security, emotions include feelings of love, worth, rejection, etc.

**Fourth chakra:** holds beliefs about love and corresponding feelings such as attraction, compassion, gratitude.

* Dysfunctional beliefs or ignored feelings can inhibit chakra function, leading to psychological issues and physical health problems.
* Chakras are activated in sequence during development, "locking in" conclusions about the environment.
* Negative beliefs and emotions can be released through chakra healing and clearing. 
* **Close connection between emotions, chakras, and physical body**: example of a woman with coccygeal pain and mother's fall during pregnancy.
* Woman's unconscious guilt for causing her mother's problems led to carrying her mother's pain.
* After addressing feelings about mother's death and guilt, the pain disappeared.

### 3. CHAKRAS PROCESS SPIRITUALLY

* Chakras are a part of the spiritual journey towards enlightenment

**Spiritual Truth and Guidance:**
- Each chakra is a step towards enlightenment
- Achieving enlightenment requires effort and resilience
- The chakra system offers spiritual guidance and inspiration

**Chakra Gifts:**
- Innate psychic abilities or gifts within each chakra
- Physical, emotional, and mental empathy
- Healing
- Intuitive abilities

**Impact of Life Events on Chakras:**
- Damage to natural psychic abilities can occur due to physical or psychological events
- **Negative effects**: closing down access to empathy, hypervigilance, anxiety, absorbing others' issues
- **Positive effects**: opening up too much, becoming overly sensitive

**Example with Third Chakra:**
- **John's story**: anxiety and oversensitivity to others' fears
- Psychic data about others picked up through third chakra
- Overloading system with others' mental activity causes anxiety
- Techniques used to help close down the third chakra and reduce sensitivity to others' fears

**Chakra Medicine:**
- Can affect us in unusual ways
- Techniques used for clearing and healing chakras.

### DEEPER INTO CHAKRAS AND ENERGY

- **Physical or sensory energy**: slow-moving energy
- **Causal energy**: serves as a blueprint for subtle and physical energy
- **Other dimensions**: 10 dimensions, each with unique properties (length, width, depth, time, possible futures, universes)

**Energetic Anatomy:**

### SANSKRIT: ANCIENT LANGUAGE OF BEAUTY, COMPLEXITY, AND POWER

**Sanskrit:** ancient language associated with India, considered the oldest written language

- **Meaning**: "refined" or "purified"
- **Opposite of prakita**: "natural" or "vulgar"
- Called the language of the gods
- Contains 50 letters (consonants, vowels, semivowels)
- Each letter has a particular vibration and corresponds to an aspect of the Absolute
- Used to create myriad possibilities with sounds and combinations
- **Alphabet called devanagari**: "cities of the gods"
- **Forms basis of mantras**: word formulas made by combining sound vibrations
- Sanskrit believed to create concepts within which we live and express ourselves

**Sanskrit Alphabet:**

- **Fifty letters**: consonants, vowels, semivowels

- Invites a change in the natural realm
- **Nonlocal**: unbound within time and space, explains chakras' ability to transcend time and space
- Chakras keep our feet on the ground and heads in the stars
- Interconnectivity explained by quantum physics
- **Ultimate implication of nonlocality**: everyone and everything is inseparable.

### A THUMBNAIL HISTORY OF THE CHAKRAS

* Chakras are an ancient concept from Sanskrit language, meaning "spinning wheel" or "disk"
* Originates from Vedic texts, around 1500-500 BCE
* Associated with tantra and yoga practices
* Concepts of celestial order, movement, and balance
* Seven main chakras in the body, but numbers vary between different traditions
* Originated from Hinduism, but also present in other cultures (Kabbalah, Incan tradition, etc.)
* Sir John Woodroffe (Arthur Avalon) popularized the belief of seven main chakras in the early 1900s
* No standard system of chakras; each school and teacher may have their own interpretation
* Each chakra contributes vital functions to body, mind, and soul
* Subtle systems rely on subtle energy, explored in detail in Hinduism.

### SUBTLE ENERGY ACROSS TIME
 
* **Subtle energy is a vital force described in various cultures throughout history with different names**: 
  - chi (TCM, Japan)
  - ki (Japan)
  - prana (East Indian spiritualities)
  - reiki
  - olodumare
  - vital force
  - mana
  - orgone
  - Odic force
  - élan vital
  - innate intelligence
  - vis medicatrix naturae
  - kundalini.
* **Orgone energy, as proposed by Wilhelm Reich**, is a massless but ever-present substance that coalesces to form matter on all levels and is the fundamental creative force of nature.
* Deficits or constrictions of orgone energy can lead to diseases and life imbalances, while robust orgone energy promotes good health and well-being. 
* **Subtle energies are used in various healing systems**:
  - **Eastern practices**:
    - TCM
    - shiatsu
    - ayurveda
    - kahuna
    - reflexology
    - qigong
    - t'ai chi
  - Western practices 
    - homeopathy
    - chiropractic care
    - massage
    - Healing Touch Program
    - Therapeutic Touch
    - Energetic Freedom Technique
* Subtle energy produces physical change through measurable and immeasurable energetic fields called the biofield.
* The biofield is a complex electromagnetic field within and around the body, consisting of both measurable and immeasurable subtle energy.
* Measurable parts of the biofield can be assessed using devices like ECG, EEG, and SQUID.
* Subtle energy practitioners alter the biofield to shift energetic anatomy, including chakras, and restore health in the biofield, which can heal the body.

- **Sanskrit meaning**: "life energy" (feminine)
  - Coiled energy beginning in a little pot of earth
  - Bestowed perpetual consciousness when awakened by the Bestower
- Worldwide phenomenon with various names and representations
  - Quetzalcoatl, the plumed serpent, in Central and South America
  - Depicted as a snake swallowing its own tail (ouroboros)
- Hindu literature portrays it as a red or rainbow-colored serpent or snake.

### THE RAINBOW SERPENT: CLIMBING THE CHAKRA LADDER
 
* **Kundalini**: A dormant life energy represented as a serpent coiled at the base of the first chakra in Hindu belief. 
* **Symbolism**: Kundalini is feminine, red, and lies at the muladhara chakra. It awakens when summoned and travels through nadis to activate seven chakras. 
* **Goal**: To reach the seventh chakra (crown of the head) for enlightenment (samadhi), merging feminine and masculine energies. 
* **Associations**: Celestial beings, goddess Shakti (female energy, fire), and her male consort Shiva (male energy). 
* **Nadis**: Energy channels transporting kundalini throughout the body; 72,000 nadis in some traditions. 
* **Three Main Nadis**: sushumna (central channel), ida (feminine, left nostril), and pingala (masculine, right nostril). 
* **Challenges**: Kundalini must pass through three energetic locks (granthis) guarding the first, fourth, and sixth chakras. 
* **Granthis**: Guardians of chakras that challenge kundalini's rising; ask us to examine security, love, and self-image issues. 
* **Benefits and Challenges**: Transformative process leads to self-realization but also involves dealing with material world attachments and personal issues. 
* **Three Locks**: Brahma (childhood abuse, financial challenges, addictions), Vishnu (lovability, relationship needs, heart conditions), Rudra (appearance, self-worth, body image).

### THE SHEATHS OF ENLIGHTENMENT

* The five koshas (sheaths) are veils that separate us from our true divine selves, described in the Upanishads

**Annamaya Kosha:**
- Contains teachings related to having a physical body
- Achieve physical balance by caring for and respecting physical needs

**Pranamaya Kosha:**
- Energy or life-force body, part of the subtle body
- Embrace it by deepening breath and attuning it with the physical body

**Manomaya Kosha:**
- Mental body related to our nervous system
- Calm and soothe it to unify mind and body

**Vijanamaya Kosha:**
- Wisdom body reflecting consciousness
- Comes alive when first three koshas are unified

**Anandamaya Kosha:**
- Bliss body, awakened when we experience the beauty of every moment

* Kundalini rises through nadis to stir chakras, forming basis for enlightenment
* Process involves ups and downs but is a love story of Shiva and Shakti (male and female aspects)
* Koshas act as lesson plans guiding spiritual maturation.

### THE LOVE STORY OF THE CHAKRAS: SHIVA AND SHAKTI

**A Tantric Perspective**

- Shiva and Shakti are the divine masculine and feminine in tantric philosophy
- They represent consciousness (Shiva) and manifested reality (Shakti)
- Their love story is an allegory for the rise of kundalini

**Shiva and Shakti: The Unified Consciousness**

- Shiva and Shakti are one, embodied in human beings as chakras
- They exist in tat, or eternal consciousness
- Everything in physical reality comes from the bindu, or point
- When unmanifested, bindu is the home of Shakti and Shiva

**The Separation: From Unity to Duality**

- In order to create physical reality, Shiva and Shakti separated
- Our Shiva selves remained in the divine realm, our Shakti selves became form
- Kundalini activation is a means of reconnecting with our divine selves

**The Process of Union: Maya and Prakasha**

- **Downward movement (maya)**: awakening of dormant power
- **Upward movement (prakasha)**: enlightenment or kundalini rising through chakras
- Encouraging union through chanting "aum" or "om"

**Understanding Kundalini: Importance and Challenges**

- Kundalini awakening is essential for self-development
- Understanding the process of union helps comprehend kundalini's effects and importance.

### THE PINEAL GLAND: SAHASRARA’S ENDOCRINE GLAND

- The pineal gland is a pinecone-shaped gland located in the midbrain behind the pituitary gland.
  - Developed from the roof of the diencephalon.
  - Lies between the two hemispheres of the brain, near several other glands and structures.
  - Covered by neurons from the retina of the eye.
- Composed of pinealocytes and glial cells:
  **Pinealocytes:**
    - Non-nerve cells involved in melatonin production.
    - Make the pineal gland sensitive to environmental light.
  **Glial Cells:**
    - Make up about 90% of brain cells.
    - Contribute to thought and imagination.
      *Neuroscientist Andrew Koob suggests they might be the source of imagination.*
    - Use calcium as a messenger for chemical signaling.
    - Send messages throughout the body, repairing injuries, defending against disease, healing neurons, and eradicating pathogens.
    - Maintain correct concentrations of ions and neurotransmitters in the neural environment.
    - Help decide what substances can pass through the blood-brain barrier into the brain.
    - Linked with the pituitary gland through the third cerebral ventricle.

**Functions of Glial Cells Relevant to Sahasrara and Kundalini Transformation:**

* Opening the higher siddhi:
  * Enabling visions and experiences related to higher consciousness.
  * Requires the use of imagination.
* Superhuman healing of disease.
* Making use of substances potentially found in the amrita, such as calcium, fluids, and ions.
* Allowing pineal gland to receive substances through the blood-brain barrier that are not allowed into other parts of the brain.
* Affecting the relationship between a dysfunctional pineal gland and an increased susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and more.
* Promoting the development of the third eye.
        
**Pineal Gland**

- Considered the "seat of the soul" by ancients and Descartes
- Endocrine gland with vital functions:
  - Regulates bodywide endocrine functions
  - Nervous system's relationship with endocrine signals
  - Circadian rhythms and sleep
  - Sexual development

**Chemical Sequence**

- Tryptophan (essential amino acid)
  * Used to make melatonin and serotonin
- Melatonin
  * Aids in sleep and seasonal changes
  * Acts as antioxidant and anticarcinogen
  * Studied for preventing high blood pressure, alcoholism, epilepsy, etc.
- Serotonin
  * Neurotransmitter regulating sleep, body temperature, appetite, emotions
- Pinoline
  * Involved in consciousness
  - 5-MeO-DMT and DMT (tryptamines)
    * Produced in small amounts in the body
    * Also found in certain toads, plants, seeds, bark resin
    * Used for hallucinatory effects
    * Linked with mystical experiences
      * Childbirth, sexual bliss, physical distress, near-death phenomena
      * Can create visions and spiritual contact

**Balancing Chemicals**

- Correct balance of all pineal gland chemicals necessary for positive mystical experiences
- Pinoline prevents serotonin breakdown but too much leads to hallucinations, depression, mania, acute psychotic breakdowns

**Siddhis and Enlightenment**

- All siddhis (powers) available upon activation of sahasrara chakra
- True yogi understands enlightenment isn't about using powers but recognizing inherent unity

**Electromagnetic Sensor**

- Sensitive to magnetic fields
- Balances earth's negative field and sun's positive force for optimal health
- Pineal gland synchronizes circadian and seasonal reactions with biological changes
- Closely affiliated with magnetic sensing materials (crystals) in the brain, mainly magnetite
  * Found in bees, birds, fish, bacteria, and humans
  * Produces more when needed
- **Crystals found in most human brain tissue**: single-domain crystals per gram for most tissues, over a hundred million crystals per gram for pia matter and dura matter.
        
**Research shows that the entirety of the body is a gigantic electromagnetic frequency (EMF) generator**

* The body functions as a giant electromagnetic frequency (EMF) generator due to its piezoelectrical properties
* Piezoelectric crystal lattice in the body can convert EMF oscillations to mechanical vibrations and vice versa
* External EMF fields can induce bone formation, energy production in cells, protein synthesis, etc.
* Magnetite crystals linked to pineal gland functions, including response to light and magnetism
* Most individuals' pineal glands calcify into "brain sand" by teen years, leading to decreased sense of direction and potential inhibition of all pineal gland functions
* Calcite crystals in the pineal gland support its piezoelectrical properties 
* **Exposure to extreme or artificial EMF fields negatively affects pineal gland function**:
  * Study on individuals exposed to 60 Hz EMF for eight weeks showed decreased pineal activity (Wilson et al., Journal of Pineal Research)
  * Study on railway workers exposed to 16.6 Hz magnetic fields also showed decreased pineal secretion 
* **Negative effects of EMF on the body include**:
  * Decline in immune resistance
  * Increase in abnormal cell development, including cancer, birth defects, infertility
  * Psychological problems such as drug addiction, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders
* Underarousal of EMF can lead to reactive depression, ADHD, chronic pain, insomnia
* Overarousal of EMF can lead to anxiety, sleep onset problems, nightmares, impulsivity, anger, aggressiveness, nerve pain
* Combination of under- and overarousal can create a blend of anxiety and depression as well as ADHD 
* **Factors affecting pineal gland health besides EMF include**:
  * Unusual light and dark rhythms
  * Radiation
  * Nutritional imbalances
  * Temperature swings
  * Sunspots
  * Moon's rotation
  * Revolution of planets
  * High altitude
  * Daily stress 
* **Restoring the pineal gland through "kindling" process**:
  * Entraining brain nerves with positive EMF, such as earth's magnetic fields
  * Meditation produces similar effect, cascading entire brain with alpha and theta fields
  * Alpha waves (7-13 cycles per second) encourage dreaming, creativity, deeper states of consciousness
  * Theta waves (4-7 cycles per second) associated with mystery, healing, extraordinary experiences
* Various chakra healing modalities, including shamanic dancing and drumming, help accomplish attunement to natural frequencies.

### PARTNERS IN PERCEPTION: THE PINEAL AND THE PITUITARY

- The pineal and pituitary glands work together in mystical activities, including kundalini and psychism (Shri Kumarswamiji)
- **Located near each other in the brain**:
  - Pineal gland is situated in midbrain, behind and above pituitary
  - Contains pigment also found in eyes, connected to thalamus
  - Thalamus relays sensory information and is a center for pain perception
  - Pituitary gland is in roof of third ventricle
- Merging essences of these glands opens the third eye (third ventricle is a narrow opening near base of cerebral hemispheres)

**Anatomy and Functioning**

- **Pineal Gland**:
  - Sits in midbrain, behind and above pituitary
  - Contains pigment also found in eyes
  - Connected to thalamus

  - Ends in oldest section of brain that regulates primal concerns
- **Pituitary Gland**:
  - Located in sphenoid cavity
  - Secretes hormones, including vasopressin and oxytocin
  - Receives secretions from pineal gland

**Kundalini and Pineal Gland Activation**

- Rising kundalini passes through nerve channels and enters medulla oblongata, pons area of brain, and pituitary gland
- Merges with pineal gland in third ventricle, leading to higher knowledge and transformation

**Amrita: The Nectar Produced by Sahasrara and Received by Ajña**

- Mixture of endogenous cannabinoids, enkephalins, vasopressin, Ca2+ ions, glutamate, oxytocin, and polarized water
- Endogenous cannabinoids affect mood, appetite, pain, inflammatory response, and memory
- Enkephalins suppress pain and create a "rush" in the body
- Vasopressin controls water retention and encourages bonding
- Ca2+ ions help pass information between neurons and along a neuron
- Glutamate helps pass messages along nerves
- Oxytocin helps people bond, induces optimism and self-esteem, heals wounds, relieves pain, provides stress relief, inspires generosity, serves as a diet aid, and prevents psychological and physiological problems
- Polarized water interacts with itself and forms an intermolecular network, likely generated by glial cells and neurons in cerebrospinal fluid under the pineal gland.

### EXERCISE: THE FIVE STEPS FOR GROUNDING

**Grounding: Five Steps**

1. **Ground:**
   * Sense the extension of your soul from head to feet and beyond.
   * Absorb natural elements (earth, air, fire, water, metal, wood, stone, light, ether, star) for physical and energetic health.
   * Connect with nature or ask for elemental energy to enter your body.

2. **Center:**
   * Establish yourself in the internal meeting ground (heart or solar plexus).

3. **Protect:**
   * Clear and repair electrical, magnetic, EMF, and auric bodies around skin.
   * Allow inner spirit to establish necessary energetic boundaries.

4. **Open:**
   * Open front and back sides of chakras safely.
   * Energetic boundaries surround vulnerable parts.

5. **Close:**
   * Close chakras after healing method.
   * Ask inner spirit or Divine to reestablish correct energetic protection.
   * Center and ground again.

### EXERCISE: SPIRIT-TO-SPIRIT

* Directly connects you with the Divine for spiritual boundaries and highest good in chakra medicine practices
* Can be used before or after grounding exercise

**Three steps:**

1. **Affirm your spiritual being and core essence of love:**
   * Recognize yourself as a spiritual entity
   * Understand that love is your fundamental nature
2. **Affirm the presence of other spiritual beings:**
   * Acknowledge those involved in chakra work (person, group, etc.)
   * Invite the presence of invisible spiritual helpers if alone
3. **Call upon and surrender to the greater Spirit:**
   * Invoke the Divine presence
   * Allow it to instruct, guide, teach, heal, protect, and help with your focus

### PHYSICAL TOOLS FOR CHAKRA MEDICINE

**Three primary tools**: pendulum, applied kinesiology, hands-on practices

**Pendulum**

* Weight suspended from a string or chain
* Detects energy swings of chakras
* Helps locate and analyze issues
* Swings in various directions based on chakra condition
* Measures outer wheel of each chakra

**Exercise: Finding Chakras with a Pendulum**

* Hold pendulum over potential chakra location
* Slightly move pendulum until it begins to swing
* Can find primary or secondary chakras

**Applied Kinesiology (Muscle Testing)**

* Uses body's instinctive response to healthy energies
* Yes = muscle strength, No = muscle weakness for most people
* Establish polarity baseline by testing true and false statements

**Exercise: Establishing a Polarity Baseline Using Muscle Testing**

* Ask subject to stand or sit, hold arm out
* Make true statement, push down on arm
* Make false statement, push down on arm
* Determine yes (muscle strength) and no (muscle weakness) responses

**Hands-on Interaction**

* Comparable to healing "wands" in chakra medicine
* Sending hand pours energy into others or self
* Receiving hand absorbs energy from outside
* Dominant hand is usually sending, recessive hand receiving but can vary

**Exercise: Establishing Your Sending and Receiving Hands**

* Shake hands, take deep breaths, rub hands together
* Separate hands, sense energy flow between them
* Evaluate intensity of sensation and ease of sending/receiving energy from each hand.

### THE INTUITION BUILDING BLOCK

- Chakra medicine involves accessing intuition through subtle energy communication
- **Intuition can be categorized into four styles**: physical, mental, spiritual, and empathic
- Understanding your intuitive style is helpful for performing chakra medicine and dealing with issues related to intuition

**Four Intuitive Styles**

- **Two kinesthetic/empathic styles**:

**Physical Intuition:**
- Sense subtle energy as physical sensations
- **Empathy**: Physical, feeling, mental, relational, and natural
- **Force empathy**: Sensing natural and supernatural forces

**Spiritual Intuition:**
- Read or comprehend subtle energy through spiritual knowing
- Prophecy, shamanism, other mystical senses
- **Difference between physical and spiritual intuitives**: Physical intuitives gain all intuition through five senses, while spiritual intuitives sense information in their bodies from a place of consciousness

**Two mental styles**:
- **Verbal Intuition:**
  - Hear words, tones, or spiritual guidance
  - Write, sing, use auditory or musical mediums for receiving/sharing intuitive info
- **Visual Intuition:**
  - Receive (and/or send) psychic images
  - Visions, pictures, colors, shapes, slideshows
  - Available through dreams, daydreams, and everyday life

### LOCATING THE CHAKRAS

- **Simple ways to locate chakras**: select a system that resonates, pendulum method, applied kinesiology, hands-on interaction, intuition

**Locating Chakras with Applied Kinesiology**

- Use yes and no response on another person
- Place hand on or over area corresponding to chakra
- Make statement "This is chakra number ____"
- Move hands until you find the chakra
- Repeat for all desired chakras

**Locating Your Own Chakras with Applied Kinesiology**

- Touch, think about, or label body part where chakra might be
- Use hand kinesiology to confirm location

**Locating Chakras with Hands-On Interaction**

- Easiest on someone else's body
- Flick hands, rub them together, create energy flow between palms
- Hold receiving hand above potential chakra site and move in gentle circles
- Sense strong pulse of energy emanating from the body
- Double-check with sending hand
- Return own system to balance by flicking hands away

**Locating Your Own Chakras with Hands-On Interaction**

- Only locate front chakras you can reach

**Locating Chakras Intuitively**

- **Access four forms of intuition**: Physical, Spiritual, Verbal, Visual
- Open psychically via Spirit-to-Spirit connection
- **For Physical Intuitive**: Sense in own body where chakras are (even if in someone else)
- **For Spiritual Intuitive**: Align with spiritual wisdom to know location
- **For Verbal Intuitive**: Hear tones or be told location by higher guide
- **For Visual Intuitive**: Receive image or set of pictures to pinpoint chakras

### EVALUATING ISSUES THROUGH THE CHAKRAS
**Chakra Evaluation through the Chakras**

- Identify the causal chakra for presenting problems or blocks.
- Blocks are congested energy preventing full flow of subtle and physical energies.
- **Origins of blocks**: repressed feelings, dysfunctional beliefs, traumas, missing energy.
- Determine causal chakra to heal issues and uncover hidden gems.

**Backgrounder: Blocks**

- Energy congestion or buildup in chakras.
- Can be physical (microbes, inflammation), emotional (repressed feelings), mental (dysfunctional beliefs), or spiritual (missing energy).
- Untie the knot to invite a restorative flow.
- Most blocks start with a program creating a pattern.

**Types of Strongholds**

**1. Feeling-Based Stronghold**
  - **Five basic feelings**: fear, anger, sadness, happiness, disgust.
    - Missing or inappropriate feelings can create blocks.
  - **Five constellations of feelings**: fear (danger), anger (boundary violation), sadness (loss), happiness (want more), disgust (something bad).
**2. Belief-Based Stronghold**
  - A belief is a proposition accepted as true.
  - **Six categories of dysfunctional beliefs**: 
    - worthless
    - undeserving
    - lack value
    - powerless
    - bad or evil
    - unwanted.
- **Healing**: embrace connectedness.

**3. Emotional Stronghold**

- An emotion is a belief partnered with a feeling.
- Helpful emotional strongholds save lives; harmful ones create negative patterns.

**4. Physical Stronghold**

- Physical reactions or sensations linked to feelings, beliefs, or emotions.
- Commonly occur following injury, wounding, or illness.

**5. Spiritual Stronghold**

- Beliefs related to our relationship with the Divine or Higher Power.
- Negative spiritual strongholds alter ability to receive love and grace.
- Attract negative entities, curses, attachments, adverse group energies.

**Types of Negative Entities and Attachments**

- **Entities**: disembodied souls that prey on the living.
- **Ghosts**: souls remaining on earth plane to complete a task.
- **Ancestral hauntings**: ancestors adversely affecting their lineage.
- **Group consciousness**: network of entities controlled by a leader.
- **Life energy cords**: link person with a part of their soul.
- **Codependent contracts**: cause person to lose energy and take in toxic energy of others.
- **Curses**: dark filaments passed among many people enacting negative wish.
- **Energy markers**: program that tells others to mistreat the person who has the marker.
- **Holds**: energy restraints keeping a part of one's life dysfunctional.
- **Miasms**: energetic fields surrounding a group of souls creating patterns.
- **Filaments**: energy strands making someone susceptible to negative influences from different dimensions or consciousness groups.
- **Implants**: began as electrical or technological control mechanisms in one life, may transfer as energetic implants in later lives.

### CHAKRA ASSESSMENT USING A CHAKRA CHART

### ASSESSING CHAKRA HEALTH WITH PENDULUM TESTING

**Assessing Chakra Health**
 
* **Use pendulum testing to assess chakra health**:
  * Clockwise swing: balanced
  * Counterclockwise swing: releasing energy or losing energy
  * Even pace with wide swing: healthy and open
  * Too wide: taking in too much information
  * Stops: closed
  * Uneven, disturbed, or tight: can't decide whether to be open or closed
  * Mainly vertical: reflecting spiritual potential but lacking practical application
  * Mainly horizontal: focused on practical functions but overlooking spiritual perspective
  * Swings towards upper right (feminine side): overemphasizing masculine concerns, requires feminine perspective
  * Swings towards upper left (masculine side): overemphasizing feminine concerns, requires masculine perspective
  * Too fast and to the right: reflecting anxiety or fear of the future
  * Too slow and counterclockwise: reflects a depressed state or issue mired in the past
* About 10% of individuals (heyoke) have reversed chakra spin
* Test for natural chakra spin using pendulum and yes/no questions
* Use applied kinesiology to assess causal chakra and issues within it
* Hands-on assessment useful for figuring out someone else's causal chakra and contributing issues

**Making Use of the Eyes in Chakra Medicine**

- Mudras may involve the eyes, which play a special role in enlightenment and are related to the physical body and sixth chakra.
- The eyes enable us to see reality and beyond (into the heavens).

**Secret of the Golden Flower**

- Ancient spiritual text rooted in Zoroastrianism, Egyptian Hermeticism, Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, and Christianity.
- Outlines a path to illumination through silent meditation techniques and circulation of essential breath energy.
- The eyes are considered crucial as they can receive negative thoughts, acting as a "heavenly heart."
- Practitioners cultivate the appearance of a bright image between their eyes (mandala, original essence, golden flower, or original light).

**Activating the Eyes**

- Sit upright and comfortable.
- Half-close eyes, looking down nose (yellow middle or center in midst of conditions).
- Allow light to stream into eyes without forcing it.
- Suspend thoughts and forget concerns.
- Allow light to shift downward.

**Trataka (Eye Gazing)**

- Buddhist practice for cultivating the power of the eyes, stimulating ajña and opening pineal gland.
- **Two types**: outer (gazing at an object) and inner (visualizing chakras).
- Beneficial for insomnia, mental disarray, eye problems, and stress relief.

**The Four Bandhas**

- Yoga moves to regulate internal systems and release energy blocks.
- Meaning "lock," "hold," or "tighten."
- **Three primary bandhas**: mula (root lock), uddiyana (fly up or rise up), jalandhara (throat lock).
- Maha Bandha (great lock) combines all three.
